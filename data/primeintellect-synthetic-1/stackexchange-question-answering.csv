Question:
Suppose $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a family of bounded, differentiable, monotone increasing functions on $[0,1]$ , which converge uniformly to a limit $f$ .  Also, suppose we know that $f_n'$ is $\alpha$ -Lipschitz continuous for some constant $\alpha$ (not depending on $n$ ).   I want to analyze the differentiability of $f$ and the convergence of $f_n'$ , if this is even possible. Of course, the monotone increasing property of $f_n$ implies that $f$ is also monotone increasing, so it is differentiable Lebesgue almost surely on $[0,1]$ .  Is it possible to say that $f_n'$ converges to $f'$ pointwise, wherever $f'$ exists (even if only on a subsequence)?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The answer is positive, and weaker assumptions suffice. Claim: Suppose $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a family of bounded, differentiable,  functions on $[0,1]$ , which converge pointwise  to a limit $f$ .  Also, suppose we know that $\{f_n'\}$ are a uniformly equicontinuous $^{(*)}$ family of functions.Then $f$ is differentiable on $[0,1]$ and $f_n' \to f$ uniformly. $(*)$ (Equicontinuity, defined in [1],  certainly holds if $f_n'$ are $\alpha$ -Lipschitz continuous for some constant $\alpha$ not depending on $n$ . In fact,  Holder continuity with uniform constants also suffices.). Proof of claim: Since $f_n$ are uniformly bounded and $\{f_n'\}$ are  uniformly equicontinuous, it follows $^{\bf (**)}$ that the derivatives $f'_n$ are uniformly bounded. The Ascoli-Arzela theorem [1] implies that $f_n'$ has a subsequence $f'_{n(k)}$ that converges uniformly to some $g \in C[0,1]$ .Therefore, for all $t$ in $[0,1]$ , $$f(t)-f(0)=\lim_k \int_0^t f'_{n(k)}(x) \,dx = \int_0^t g(x) \,dx \,,$$ so $f'=g$ in $[0,1]$ by the fundamental theorem of calculus. If $f'_n$ do not  converge  uniformly to $g=f'$ , then there exists some $\epsilon>0$ and  another subsequence $f'_{m(k)}$ of $f_n'$ , such that $\|f'_{m(k)}-f'\|_\infty >\epsilon$ for all $k$ .But $f'_{m(k)}$ must also have a uniformly convergent subsequence by [1],and the argument above shows that the limit of this subsequence must be $f'$ , a contradiction.Thus $f'_n \to f'$ uniformly in $[0,1]$ . $(**)$ Addendum: Since  there exists $M$ such that $|f_n| \le M$ in $[0,1]$ for all $n$ ,    the mean value theorem implies that for each $n$ , there is some $t_n \in (0,1)$ such that $|f_n'(t_n)|=|f_n(1)-f_n(0)| \le 2M$ . Since $f_n'$ are uniformly equicontinuous, there is some $\delta_1<1 $ so that $|x-y|<\delta_1$ implies $|f_n(x)-f_n(y)|<1$ for all $n$ . Thus for all $n \ge 1$ and all $x \in [0,1]$ , we have $|f_n'(x)-f_n'(t_n)| \le 1+1/\delta_1$ , so $|f_n'(x)| \le 2M+1+1/\delta_1$ .

Question:
My research indicates that, if I create a cookie and don't set the expiration date, it will expire when the browser is closed. So I created a cookie like this: Response.Cookies.Set(new HttpCookie(""MyKey"", ""X"")); But when I close the browser and then reopen it, the following expression equals true: Request.Cookies[""MyKey""] != null How can I have the cookie expire when the browser session ends? Note: For my purposes, using static data instead of a cookie seems ideal. But my understanding is that an ASP.NET can restart for a variety of reasons, and that could pull the rug out from under the current user if I lost this setting.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It appears the issue is as Stober described. You can set a cookie to expire at the end of the browser session by setting the HttpCookie.Expires property to DateTime.MinDate , or not setting the property at all. However, at least with Chrome's pick up where you left off settings, it appears that the browser session does not necessarily end when the browser closes. When closed and then reopened, the Chrome browser picks up right where it left off, as if the session never ended. This includes continuing to use cookies set expire at the end of the session. I tried my same code on FireFox. Closing and reopening the browser caused the cookie to expire, exactly as expected. So while there are some general rules, in the end this behavior is totally up to the browser.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/17736737', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/522663/']}",jdg_232037

Question:
openCV 2.4.3 / Xcode 4.5.2  / mac osx 10.8.2 I am trying to get openCV working with iOS. I am attempting to use the the prebuilt 2.4.3 framework from openCV.org.  However I am getting the following xcode project build errors that suggest the compiler doesn't know it is dealing with c++, eg #include <list>       !'list' file not foundnamespace cv          !unknown type name 'namespace' This only seems to concern the following header files: ""opencv2/nonfree/features2d.hpp"" ""opencv2/nonfree/nonfree.hpp"" ""opencv2/video/video.hpp"" if I don't include these three files in opencv.hpp (or anywhere else) I seem to be able to compile and use openCV ok. The trouble is, I do need the nonfree files as I am experimenting with SURF - which has been moved to nonfree recently. This is really a twofold question (sorry ;-) how do I convince the compiler that these are c++ headers? which headers exactly do I need to use SURF? update I have cloned the openCV git repository and built a new framework from that. This approach had not worked previously, but today I realised that I was not using the current version of CMAKE. I had been using CMAKE 2.8.2 and this would fail to build opencv for ios. Current version CMAKE 2.8.10 builds it without any issues (that's an object lesson in obeying the docs, which do say CMAKE min. v2.8.8 is required). Now when I add this current build of the opencv framework in an Xcode project I can include features2d and nonfree and build smoothly. The only problem remains with one header: video/background_segm.hpp , which still yields: #include <list>       !'list' file not found If I comment that line out I get an error on the next line: namespace cv          !unknown type name 'namespace' It seems clear that the compiler doesn't recognise this as a C++ header, even though it is suffixed .hpp . In opencv2/video/video.hpp if I remove #include ""opencv2/video/background_segm.hpp"" I can build with video.hpp also (although I guess it would be unusable in practice). Unfortunately I still can't get SURF to work. When I run the project it crashes with this error: OpenCV Error: The function/feature is not implemented (OpenCV was built without SURF support) This is triggered in legacy/features2d.cpp : Ptr<Feature2D> surf = Algorithm::create<Feature2D>(""Feature2D.SURF"");   if( surf.empty() )        CV_Error(CV_StsNotImplemented, ""OpenCV was built without SURF support""); The questions remain... how do I convince the compiler that background_segm.hpp is a legit c++ header? how do I enable SURF support?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I have everything working now. After having no joy with the pre-built iOS library available from openCV.org this is what I did... compile openCV for iOS from a clone of the gitHub repository. Run build_framework.py (in the ios folder of the distribution), pointing to an output directory of your choosing. Be sure to have an up-to-date copy of CMake or you will trip over  like I did. Your output folder will end up with two subfolders, build and opencv2.framework . Drag the latter into your Xcode project Add the following line in the project-Prefix.pch file #ifdef __cplusplus#import <opencv2/opencv.hpp>#endif (should go above the #ifdef __OBJC__ line) That is sufficient to get most of openCV working. However it is a very good idea to avoid ""objective-C++"" (mixing your c++ code in the same files as your objective-C). To manage this you create a thin ""wrapper"" object (which will be obj-C++) to mediate between your obj-C classes and c++ code. The wrapper essentially has only two roles: to translate data formats (eg UIImage <-> cv::Mat), and to translate between obj-C methods and C++ function calls. See my answer to this question for details (and a github-hosted example project) To get SURF (and SIFT) working requires a couple of additional steps, as SURF is somewhat deprecated due to licensing issues (it's been moved into nonfree which does not load automatically). These includes need to be added in files where you are using SURF #include <opencv2/nonfree/nonfree.hpp>#include <opencv2/legacy/compat.hpp> The code I am working with uses the C interfaces for SURF (eg cvExtractSURF ), so we also need to add this line before calling these functions: cv::initModule_nonfree(); The other part of my question, how to force Xcode to compile as C++, was a bit of a red herring (there must have been something compatibility issue with the openCV build I was using) - and is no longer required for this solution. However the answer is first, to rename your .m files .mm (for objective-C++) or .cpp (for pure C++) … but if that doesn't work, you can force the issue in the file inspector by changing 'file type'. update You also need to take care that the C++ standard library is set correctly in any projects that use the openCV framework. Older versions of openCV (to.2.4.2) want libstdc++ , newer (2.4.3+) expect libc++ . Details here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14186883/1375695 update 2 openCV now installs with cocoaPods.

Below is a question asked on the forum math.stackexchange.com. Provide a good and informational response to it like a helpful human would.

Question:
I am confused about the significance of the powers on equations. For example, in $ax = b$, intuitively $b$ is a value $x$ multiplied $a$ times. In $ax + b = c$, $c$ is a value $x$ multiplied $a$ times added to by $b$. In $ax^2 + bx + c = d$, $d$ is a value $x$ multiplied by itself and by another value $a$ added to by the $x$ multiplied by a value $b$ and that added to by another value $c$. This and so on. Even in the simple equation $x^2 = y$, $x$ is intuitively $\sqrt{y}$ and so on for arbitrary powers and roots. For the equation $x + x = y$, $x$ is placed doubly and $y$ is equal to that doubled x, so $x$ would be $y$ halved. But when a particular case like $x^2 + x = y$ arises and so on with all orders and polynomials of those orders (""higher order equations""), it cannot be solved so easily and the whole process begins to seem much more foreign and contrived. Why am I no longer able to intuitively solve for the unknown in such an equation when an exponent greater than one is used? Why doesn't the seamless reversing of operations to solve extend to higher order equations?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I think the difference you are picking up on has to do with the structure of the equation itself.  In some equations, the unknown $x$ is acted on serially through a sequence of nested operations; solving the equation amounts to ""unwinding"" those operations one by one.  For example, $\frac{(3x+5)^2-19}{2}=10$ can be thought of as ""take $x$, triple it, add $5$, square the result, subtract $19$, and divide by $2$; the result is $10$.  You can diagram this as a series of functions like so: So to solve it, you reverse those steps:  Start with $10$, multiply it by $2$, add $19$, take the square root, subtract $5$, divide by $3$. But in other equations -- even fairly simple ones -- have a different kind of structure.  For example, $x^2+5x=10$ looks like this: Notice that this structure resists any attempt to solve it by ""unwinding"", precisely because of the fork in the diagram.  The $x$ flows through more than one path, which makes it impossible to trace the result backwards to its source. Some equations are presented in a form that at first appears to have multiple-paths (e.g. $3x + 5x = 16$) but we can rearrange them to a single-path structure (for example, via the distributive property / combining like terms).  But higher-degree polynomial equations typically have terms that cannot be combined , and this is what makes them resistant to the kind of intuitive solution you are asking about. Update: In the comments below, the OP asks: This makes sense, but then how are general solutions for higher order equations like the quadratic formula derived algebraically/symbolically? I am familiar with the geometric proof by completing the square, but do higher order equations suddenly require the vantage of geometry to solve? Or is there a pure/direct algebraic derivation that can be thought to extend from the basis of ""unwinding"" or the like? Although completing the square is historically geometric in origin, it can be understood in a purely algebraic way as a method of restructuring a function so that it has a ""serial"" structure, enabling it to be solved via unwinding.  Let's take the example of $x^2+5x=10$, already diagrammed above.  In completing the square, you first add $(\frac{5}{2})^2=\frac{25}{4}$ to both sides of the equation, obtaining $x^2 + 5x + \frac{25}{4} = \frac{65}{4}$.  Then you recognize the left-hand side as a perfect square trinomial, so the equation can be written $(x + \frac{5}{2})^2 = \frac{65}{4}$.  This equation, if represented diagrammatically, would have a simple serial structure:  Start with $x$, add $\frac{5}{2}$, square it, and end up with $\frac{65}{4}$.  It can then be solved by unwinding: Start with $\frac{65}{4}$, take the square root(s) (keeping in mind that there are two square roots, one positive and one negative), and subtract $\frac{5}{2}$. Of course, this is not the only method that can be used to tackle quadratics.  Consider the slightly different example of $x^2 + 5x = 24$.  If we rearrange this as $x^2 + 5x - 24 = 0$ and factor the LHS, we get $(x-3)(x+8)=0$.  This equation can be diagrammed as follows: At first glance this looks to be no better than the original equation; it has a fork in it, and seems resistant to unwinding. But! There is this property of real numbers, the ""zero product property"", which says that if two numbers multiply to be zero, then one of them must be zero.  And that allows you to split the diagram into two separate diagrammatic cases: And each of those can be tackled via a very simple unwinding method. In short, most of the techniques that are taught (at least at the high school level) for solving polynomial equations can be understood as ""methods for re-structuring equations so that unwinding techniques can be employed"".  (I'm not claiming that they are taught in those terms, or that they should be, but merely that they can be thought of that way.) Unfortunately this only gets you so far.  Once you get to 5th degree polynomials, it is a famous result that there may be solutions that cannot be expressed by a combination of ""simple"" operations (see here ).  That means, among other things, that there is no way to restructure a general 5th degree polynomial so as to enable a solution via unwinding techniques.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/836362', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/62522/']}",jdg_97441

","(Theoretically) in HTML 4 , <foo / (yes, with no > at all) means <foo> (which leads to <br /> meaning <br>> (i.e. <br>&gt; ) and <title/hello/ meaning <title>hello</title> ). I use the term ""theoretically"" because this is an SGML rule that browsers did a very poor job of supporting. There was so little support (I only ever saw it work in emacs-w3m ) that the spec advises authors to avoid the syntax . In XHTML , <foo /> means <foo></foo> . This is an XML rule that applies to all XML documents. That said, XHTML is often served as text/html which (historically at least) gets processed by browsers using a different parser than documents served as application/xhtml+xml . The W3C provides compatibility guidelines to follow for XHTML as text/html . (Essentially: Only use self-closing tag syntax when the element is defined as EMPTY (and the end tag was forbidden in the HTML spec)). In HTML5 , the meaning of <foo /> depends on the type of element : On HTML elements that are designated as void elements (essentially ""An element that existed before HTML5 and which was forbidden to have any content""), end tags are simply forbidden. The slash at the end of the start tag is allowed, but has no meaning. It is just syntactic sugar for people (and syntax highlighters) that are addicted to XML. On other HTML elements, the slash is an error , but error recovery will cause browsers to ignore it and treat the tag as a regular start tag. This will usually end up with a missing end tag causing subsequent elements to be children instead of siblings. Foreign elements (imported from XML applications such as SVG) treat it as self-closing syntax.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 11, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3558121', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/429715/']}",jdg_252970

(You can read more about different address types at https://devzone.nordicsemi.com/question/43670/how-to-distinguish-between-random-and-public-gap-addresses/ ). The getRemoteDevice method should take an additional parameter ""random address/public address"" but it doesn't. Without the correct address type, the Bluetooth controller cannot connect to the device. Android's BLE stack has some internal heuristics to ""guess"" if the address is public or random, but unfortunately that differs between Android versions and also if you use autoConnect=true or false. However if you have bonded the device ( https://developer.android.com/reference/android/bluetooth/BluetoothDevice.html#createBond() ) then it will store in its internal DB whether the given address is public or random. If the peripheral you want to connect to uses a random resolvable address it can handle that as well if you use bonding. Therefore I strongly suggest to use bonding. If you don't use bonding you will need to scan before you connect to the device, since when you start a scan and a device is detected, Android's BLE stack will temporarily (until next restart of Bluetooth) remember the address type for an address.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/43476381', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3074761/']}",jdg_172707

Question:
I was wondering how do you decide when to use converters and when to use triggers . I prefer using triggers for operations on GUI (like showing/hiding controls, changing their appearance etc.). Some time ago I used a BooleanToVisibilityConverter for this purpose but now, I just don't need it, I do all things connected to the visibility using a triggers and I even started to think "" what was the purpose of creating a BooleanToVisibilityConverter by the MS team?"". Generally, when it's possible I try to use a declarative way to write the code - in this example - XAML. What is your opinion of that?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I agree with you, I also try to use declarative code in XAML and prefer Triggers instead of Converters . In most of the scenarios triggers can perform the same work as any converter but Converters can have custom/business logic as pchajer mentioned. One limitation of Triggers is that Setters in your DataTriggers can only change properties of your UI elements ; so, you can't update your ViewModels property with triggers , thats where Converters win, remember the ConvertBack method. So, you can bind your VM property with a controls Visibility using BooleanToVisibilityConverter and even if your controls visibility is changed by some other means your VM property will get updated ; generally it's not required that's why BooleanToVisibilityConverter gets replaced by triggers. So in short - Triggers can only perform OneWay operations whereas Converters can perform TwoWay operations",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/11152313', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/218450/']}",jdg_95546

Question:
I want to get the details of the last run cron job. If the job is interrupted due to some internal problems, I want to re-run the cron job. Note: I don't have superuser privilege.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You can see the date, time, user and command of previously executed cron jobs using: grep CRON /var/log/syslog This will show all cron jobs. If you only wanted to see jobs run by a certain user, you would use something like this: grep CRON.*\(root\) /var/log/syslog Note that cron logs at the start of a job so you may want to have lengthy jobs keep their own completion logs; if the system went down halfway through a job, it would still be in the log! Edit: If you don't have root access, you will have to keep your own job logs. This can be done simply by tacking the following onto the end of your job command: && date > /home/user/last_completed The file /home/user/last_completed would always contain the last date and time the job completed. You would use >> instead of > if you wanted to append completion dates to the file. You could also achieve the same by putting your command in a small bash or sh script and have cron execute that file. #!/bin/bash[command]date > /home/user/last_completed The crontab for this would be: * * * * * bash /path/to/script.bash",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/11131490', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1449101/']}",jdg_308253

","If you want to render the notes when at least one note exists and a default view when there are no notes in the array, you can change your render function's return expression to this: return(  <div className='list'>      {notes.length ? notes : <p>Default Markup</p>}  </div>); Since empty arrays in JavaScript are truthy, you need to check the array's length and not just the boolean value of an array. Note that if your items prop is ever null, that would cause an exception because you'd be calling map on a null value.  In this case, I'd recommend using Facebook's prop-types library to set items to an empty array by default.

Question:
I have an existing class which interacts which can open, read or write to a file. I need to retrieve a file modification for that purpose I have to add a new method Suppose this following is my class definition where I want to add a new method. class IO_file{ std::string m_file_name; public: IO(); IO(std::string file_name);+ time_t get_mtime(file_name);+       OR+ time_t get_mtime();}; I have two options - Create an empty object and then pass the file_name in the method argument for which I wish to retrieve the file modification time. Pass the file name at the object construction and simply call the member function which will operate on the member variable. Both options will serve the purpose. I also believe that second approach is better than first one. But what I don't understand is How ? Is first approach bad design since it doesn't make use of a member variable? Which principle of Object oriented design does it violate?If a member function does not use the member variable, should  that member function should always be made static?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Does it violate any OOP principal if a member function does not use any of class properties/member variables? No. OOP doesn't care if your member function uses, or doesn't use, class properties or member variables.  OOP cares about polymorphism and not hard coding implementation.  Static functions have their uses but a function shouldn't be static simply because it doesn't depend on object state. If that's your thinking fine, but don't blame it on OOP because that idea didn't come from OOP. Is [it] bad design [to not] make use of member variables? If you don't need to remember state from call to call there is no good reason to use state. Which principle of Object oriented design [does] it violate? None. If a member function does not use the member variable then that member function should always be made static? No. This thinking has the implication arrow going in the wrong direction. A static function can't access instance state If the function has no need to access instance state then the function can be static or non-static Making the function static here is completely up to you.  But it will make it more like a global if you do.  Before going static consider hosting the function in a stateless class.  It's more flexible. I have here an OOP example of a member function that doesn't use class properties or member variables. The member function (and it's stateless class) : #include <iostream>class Strategy{public:     virtual int execute (int a, int b) = 0; // execute() is a so-called pure virtual                                              // function.

Question:
I was solving a problem in which i came across a radially symmetric discontinuous electric field, which puzzled me for a moment but then I figured that there must be surface charge density at the point of discontinuity causing this. My question is : Is such discontinuity in 3D always the result of a singularity like a surface charge distribution, line charge or point charge? By singularity I mean infinite volume charge density. If so, why?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Yes, a discontinuity in the electric field is always associated with a charge distribution with infinite density.  That's a necessary implication of Gauss' law.  To think of it qualitatively, where there is a discontinuity in the field, there must be field lines either starting or ending.  (If it's not obvious why that is, think about the fact that the electric field magnitude is different on one side of the discontinuity than on the other.  There will be more field lines on the side with the stronger side, or else lines pointing in different directions on the different sides if the amplitude is positive on one side and negative on the other.)  But electric field lines start and end only on charges, or at infinity. To think about it even more physically, consider the force on a positive test charge.  It will be different on either side of the discontinuity.  But electric forces are exerted by charges, so the only way to produce a jump in the force across the discontinuity is to have some charge there. In fact, it turns out that if the electric field amplitude jumps by $\Delta E$ across a discontinuity, there must be a surface charge there (charge per unit area) of magnitude $\epsilon_\circ \Delta E$.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/162998', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/72225/']}",jdg_367294

Question:
OK, I'm not entirely a newbie, but I cannot say I understand the following macro. The most confusing part is the division with value cast to size_t: what on earth does that accomplish? Especially, since I see a negation operator, which, as far as I know, might result in a zero value. Does not this mean that it can lead to a division-by-zero error?  (By the way, the macro is correct and works beautifully.) #define ARRAYSIZE(a) \  ((sizeof(a) / sizeof(*(a))) / \  static_cast<size_t>(!(sizeof(a) % sizeof(*(a)))))

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The first part (sizeof(a) / sizeof(*(a))) is fairly straightforward; it's dividing the size of the entire array (assuming you pass the macro an object of array type, and not a pointer), by the size of the first element.  This gives the number of elements in the array. The second part is not so straightforward.  I think the potential division-by-zero is intentional; it will lead to a compile-time error if, for whatever reason, the size of the array is not an integer multiple of one of its elements.  In other words, it's some kind of compile-time sanity check. However, I can't see under what circumstances this could occur...  As people have suggested in comments below, it will catch some misuse (like using ARRAYSIZE() on a pointer).

",You need to use the squeeze theorem on the given condtition $|f(x)|\le x^2$ in order to prove that $f$ is both continuous and differentiable at $x=0$: Continuity: You know that $|f(x)|\le x^2$. Substituting $x=0$ you find that $|f(0)|\le 0$ or $f(0)=0$. But this condition also can be written as $$|f(x)|\le x^2 \implies -x^2\le f(x)\le x^2$$ and so take limits ($x\to 0$) $$\lim_{x\to 0}-x^2\le \lim_{x\to 0}f(x)\le \lim_{x\to 0}x^2 $$ which gives you $$0\le \lim_{x\to 0}f(x)\le 0 \implies \lim_{x\to}f(x)=0$$So the limit of $f$ as $x$ goes to $0$ and the value of $f$ at $x=0$ coincide which implies that $f$ is continuous at $x=0$.

Question:
Please can anyone tell me how to read messages using the Kafka Consumer API from the beginning every time when I run the consumer.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","This works with the 0.9.x consumer. Basically when you create a consumer, you need to assign a consumer group id to this consumer using the property ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG . Generate the consumer group id randomly every time you start the consumer doing something like this properties.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, UUID.randomUUID().toString()); (properties is an instance of java.util.Properties that you will pass to the constructor new KafkaConsumer(properties) ). Generating the client randomly means that the new consumer group doesn't have any offset associated to it in kafka. So what we have to do after this is to set a policy for this scenario. As the documentation for the auto.offset.reset property says: What to do when there is no initial offset in Kafka or if the current offset does not exist any more on the server (e.g. because that data has been deleted): earliest: automatically reset the offset to the earliest offset latest: automatically reset the offset to the latest offset none: throw exception to the consumer if no previous offset is found or the consumer's group anything else: throw exception to the consumer. So from the options above listed we need to choose the earliest policy so the new consumer group starts from the beginning every time. Your code in java, will look something like this: properties.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, UUID.randomUUID().toString());properties.put(ConsumerConfig.CLIENT_ID_CONFIG, ""your_client_id"");properties.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, ""earliest"");consumer = new KafkaConsumer(properties); The only thing that you need to figure it out now, is when having multiple consumers that belong to the same consumer group but are distributed how to generate a random id and distribute it between those instances so they all belong to the same consumer group.

Question:
Let $\beta: H^n(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)\to H^{n+1}(X, \mathbb{Z})$ be the Bockstein homomorphism. Is it possible to define a cohomology operation $f: H^{n+1}(X, \mathbb{Z})\to H^{n+k+1}(X, \mathbb{Z})$ such that \begin{eqnarray*}\beta \text{Sq}^k=f\beta\end{eqnarray*}where $\text{Sq}^k: H^n(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)\to H^{n+k}(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)$ is the $k$-th Steenrod square? Added: It seems that when $k=2$ it is not possible. If we precompose both sides by $\rho_2:H^n(X, \mathbb{Z})\to H^n(X, \mathbb{Z}_2)$, the reduction mod 2 map, then the LHS becomes the third differential of the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence which in general does not vanish, but the RHS vanishes because $\beta\rho_2=0$.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","From the Adem relations we get $Sq^1Sq^{k-1}=(k-2)Sq^k$. It follows that for $k$ odd we have $Sq^k=Sq^1Sq^{k-1}$. Note that we have $Sq^1=\rho\beta$, where $\rho$ is mod 2 reduction, so if $k$ is odd $\beta Sq^k=\beta Sq^1Sq^{k-1}=\beta\rho\beta Sq^{k-1}=0$ since $\beta\rho\simeq \ast$. Therefore we are forced to take $f$ such that $f\beta=0$. Working stably we would then get a map $g:H\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\Sigma^{k}H\mathbb{Z}$ such that $2g=f$. That is $f$ is divisible by 2. Alternatively, any map $H\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\Sigma^{k}H\mathbb{Z}$ that is divisible by two defines an $f$ with the requried properties. There are many such examples odd-primary torsion classes that work, as well as higher 2-torsion, although it is clear that they do not exist for every odd $k$. For $k$ even $\beta Sq^k$ is nontrivial since $Sq^1Sq^k=Sq^{k+1}$. Therefore $f\beta=\beta Sq^k$ must be non-trivial as well but this cannot happen. Assume to the contrary that such an $f$ exists. Then we have that $Sq^kSq^1=Sq^k\rho\beta\in H^{k+1}(K(\mathbb{Z}_2,n-1);\mathbb{Z}_2)$ and $Sq^1Sq^kSq^1=Sq^{k+1}Sq^1\in H^{k+2}(K(\mathbb{Z}_2,n-1);\mathbb{Z}_2)$ are both non-trivial by Cartan. It follows that $0\neq Sq^{k+1}Sq^1=Sq^1Sq^{k}=\rho\beta Sq^kSq^1=\rho f\beta Sq^1=0$ Since $\beta Sq^1=0$.

Question:
One can classify the prime integers $p$ which can be written as $p=a^2+b^2$ for some integers $a,b\in\mathbb{Z}$ by studying how $p$ decomposes in the ring of Gauss integers $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. Most proofs I have seen, at some point, reason as follows: $p$ is a sum of two squares iff $p$ is non-irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ iff $-1$ is a square in $\mathbb{Z}/(p)^*$. In order to prove this, some ugly chain of isomorphisms $\mathbb{Z}[i]/(p)\simeq \ldots \simeq (\mathbb{Z}/(p))[X]/(X^2+1)$ is written down, and then one concludes that $X^2+1$ has a root in $\mathbb{Z}/(p)$ if $p$ is non-irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$. My question is this: I find this chain of isomorphisms kind of ugly and unpleasant. Is there a more direct, conceptual way to see that $p$ is non-irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}[i]$ iff $-1$ is a square in $\mathbb{Z}/(p)^*$?

","One first shows that Gaussian irreducibles $\pi$ have the basic property of ordinary primes, that if $\pi$ divides $\alpha\beta$ then $\pi$ divides $\alpha$ or $\beta$.

Suppose now that $c^2+1\equiv 0\pmod{p}$, where $p$ is an ordinary prime.  Then $p$ divides $(c-i)(c+i)$.

","The term you are looking for is called heteroscedasticity .

Question:
I don't think my question has any connection to vehicle maintenance or repair but I think this is the closest site to my question topic. My question may be arising from misunderstanding. For that I'm going to assume a few hypothesis. The brake fluid is incompressible(which is correct) and there is no air in the braking system so it doesn't affect its performance. We're assuming there is no brake force boosting effects in the system for the sake of simplicity. If I press the brake pedal and it moves that means that the slave cylinders move.(correct me if I'm wrong) Now my question is if the fluid moves when the slave cylinders move then Shouldn't the fluid be confined for Pascal's to apply? The brake pedal should stop getting further depressed after the slave cylinders press the brake pads and brake disk , is that correct?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You are correct, the brake pedal should only move when any of the 4 or more slave cylinder pistons move (some vehicles may have multiple cylinders in a caliper). Once the pistons of the slave cylinders are pressing firmly against the brake pads, the brake pedal should in theory become very solid and not possible to press further.  There will be some very small amounts of flex in some components, like the flexible brake hoses and even some flexing of the metal parts. When the brake pedal is released, the fluid pressure is released and hence the slave cylinders are able to release pressure on the brake pads. The piston in the master cylinder has a fairly small diameter compared to the diameter of the pistons in the multiple slave cylinders, so the amount of movement of the brake pedal is greatly amplified compared to the brake pad movement.  This allows a small amount of pressure (but large movement) on the brake pedal to create a very large pressure (but small movement) on the brake pads.  Without this you would find it very difficult to press the brakes hard enough to stop the vehicle.  I presume this is the point you are questioning.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/90491', 'https://mechanics.stackexchange.com', 'https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/74314/']}",jdg_295095

In AppController there exists: function afterFilter() {    if ($this->response->statusCode() == '404')    {        $this->redirect(array(            'controller' => 'mycontroller',            'action' => 'error', 404),404        );    }} But this doesn't create a 404 status code. It creates a 302 code.I changed code to this: $this->redirect('/mycontroller/error/404', 404); But the result is same. I added this, it didn't work also deprecated: $this->header('http/1.0 404 not found'); How can I send a 404 code within controller redirect ?

","If you want to return a 404 error, use the built in CakeError support for it: throw new NotFoundException(); You can throw this exception from your controller and it should generate a 404 response. There are more built-in exceptions here . If you are interested in making a custom error page, then see this post . Otherwise, I don't think it is possible to return a 404 header code and still redirect.

Question:
There are numerous states that have proposed/passed anti-protest laws in recent weeks. Please explain how it's possible to compose text, and have it pass into law, which clearly abridges the 1st Amendment's freedom of assembly clause . I certainly understand the ""legal challenge"" aspect wherein if a law is thought to be unconstitutional, it is put through its legal paces. But how can a law be put in force that outlaws the first and most basic civil liberty? I'm not asking for a civics lesson--I want to know how it's legal to pass a law which requires breaking a tenet of the very framework laws are based upon. Addendum: Should I move this question to Legal Community?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","In theory, legislators have a sworn duty to only pass laws that are constitutional. See United States Constitution, Article VI, Section 3: The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of  the several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial  Officers, both of the United States and of the several States, shall  be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no  religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office  or public Trust under the United States. But, in practice, the only remedy someone has available if the legislature passes an unconstitutional law is to have a court determine that the law is invalid , which a court will only do in the event of an actual live dispute over its validity (the case or controversy requirement see U.S. Constitution, Article III, Section 2, Clause 1 ) by someone actually materially affected by the law (the standing requirement ). Legislators have absolute immunity from lawsuits over passing unconstitutional laws. See U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 6 (in the pertinent part): They shall in all cases, except treason, felony and breach of the  peace, be privileged from arrest during their attendance at the  session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from  the same; and for any speech or debate in either House, they shall not  be questioned in any other place. Similarly, a legislature is usually considered to be an organ of the government rather than an entity in its own right that can be sued for money damages or injunctive relief, in most cases. Instead, it has governmental immunity from lawsuits . Indeed, the fact that courts can overturn an unconstitutional law is one reason that legislators feel less obligated to make sure that laws that they pass are constitutional than they would under a regime of parliamentary sovereignty in which there was no form of judicial review of legislation available, because they don't have the last word on the question. In a regime of parliamentary sovereignty, legislators have a greater personal moral responsibility to uphold democratic and human rights norms in their legislation. See, e.g., here . The idea behind the case and controversy and standing rules is that the American legal system interprets laws in a very context and fact dependent way, and also that the American legal system has always had comparative few judges relative to other legal systems . Indeed, often, it is impossible to know if a law is unconstitutional or not under the relevant legal standard until it is applied . So, this rule limits lawsuits that may or may not affect anyone (to conserve judicial resources), and requires that there be a context to illuminate and illustrate what the law means in a real world context rather than in the abstract. The standing requirement also prevents people who actually like an unconstitutional law from bringing a sham lawsuit to declare it invalid and then intentionally losing the lawsuit. See, e.g., Antonin Scalia, "" The Doctrine of Standing As An Essential Element Of The Separation Of Powers "", 17 Suffolk University Law Review 881, 891 (1983). As noted above, these requirements are rooted in Section 2, Clause 1 of Article III of the United States Constitution and the legal doctrines developed around it which have been interpreted to prohibit the filing of advisory opinions. A minority of U.S. states and many countries have a different process that allows minorities in the legislature and certain other officials to seek advisory opinions on the constitutionality of laws passed by a legislature before it takes effect. Sometimes these questions are ruled on by a ""Supreme Court"" ( see, e.g. , the advisory and suo moto powers of the Supreme Court of India and the power of the Supreme Court of Canada to issue "" reference opinions ""), sometimes by a body called a ""Constitutional Court"" ( see, e.g. , Germany's Federal Constitutional Court ) and sometimes by a body called a "" Council of State "". The Founders of the United States in the Constitutional Convention that produced the current U.S. Constitution which took effect in 1789, considered creating a similar body in the United States called a "" Council of Revision "" under a plan proposed by the Virginia delegation. But, this proposal was expressly rejected because judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation by the federal courts would provide sufficient means to ensure the constitutionality of legislation, and the institution would therefore be redundant. More generally, pre-enactment constitutional review of legislation is not a core part of the U.S. legal culture, which it derived largely from the legal culture of England at the time of the American Revolution. This common law legal tradition had no historical traditional of judicial review of legislation at that time. Even today, after many reforms of its judicial system, the newly created U.K. Supreme Court can only hear appeals of lower court cases , much like the U.S. Supreme Court outside its very narrow trial court jurisdiction, and does not have the authority to issue advisory opinions.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/19368', 'https://politics.stackexchange.com', 'https://politics.stackexchange.com/users/12008/']}",jdg_167383

Question:
I wanted to check whether g++ supports tail calling so I wrote this simple program to check it: http://ideone.com/hnXHv using namespace std;size_t st;void PrintStackTop(const std::string &type){    int stack_top;    if(st == 0) st = (size_t) &stack_top;    cout << ""In "" << type << "" call version, the stack top is: "" << (st - (size_t) &stack_top) << endl;}int TailCallFactorial(int n, int a = 1){    PrintStackTop(""tail"");    if(n < 2)        return a;    return TailCallFactorial(n - 1, n * a);}int NormalCallFactorial(int n){    PrintStackTop(""normal"");    if(n < 2)        return 1;    return NormalCallFactorial(n - 1) * n;}int main(int argc, char *argv[]){    st = 0;    cout << TailCallFactorial(5) << endl;    st = 0;    cout << NormalCallFactorial(5) << endl;    return 0;} When I compiled it normally it seems g++ doesn't really notice any difference between the two versions: > g++ main.cpp -o TailCall> ./TailCallIn tail call version, the stack top is: 0In tail call version, the stack top is: 48In tail call version, the stack top is: 96In tail call version, the stack top is: 144In tail call version, the stack top is: 192120In normal call version, the stack top is: 0In normal call version, the stack top is: 48In normal call version, the stack top is: 96In normal call version, the stack top is: 144In normal call version, the stack top is: 192120 The stack difference is 48 in both of them, while the tail call version needs one moreint. (Why?) So I thought optimization might be handy: > g++ -O2 main.cpp -o TailCall> ./TailCallIn tail call version, the stack top is: 0In tail call version, the stack top is: 80In tail call version, the stack top is: 160In tail call version, the stack top is: 240In tail call version, the stack top is: 320120In normal call version, the stack top is: 0In normal call version, the stack top is: 64In normal call version, the stack top is: 128In normal call version, the stack top is: 192In normal call version, the stack top is: 256120 The stack size increased in both cases, and while the compiler might think my CPU is slower than my memory (which its not anyway), I don't know why 80 bytes are necessary for a simple function. (Why is it?). There tail call version also takes more space than the normal version, and its completely logical if an int has the size of 16 bytes. (no, I don't own a 128 bit CPU). Now thinking what reason the compiler has not to tail call, I thought it might be exceptions, because they depend on the stack tightly. So I tried without exceptions: > g++ -O2 -fno-exceptions main.cpp -o TailCall> ./TailCallIn tail call version, the stack top is: 0In tail call version, the stack top is: 64In tail call version, the stack top is: 128In tail call version, the stack top is: 192In tail call version, the stack top is: 256120In normal call version, the stack top is: 0In normal call version, the stack top is: 48In normal call version, the stack top is: 96In normal call version, the stack top is: 144In normal call version, the stack top is: 192120 Which cut the normal version back to non-optimized stack size, while the optimized one has 8 bytes over it. still an int is not 8 bytes. I thought there is something I missed in c++ that needs the stack arranged so I tried c: http://ideone.com/tJPpc Still no tail calling, but the stack is much smaller (32 bit each frame in both version).Then I tried with optimization: > gcc -O2 main.c -o TailCall> ./TailCallIn tail call version, the stack top is: 0In tail call version, the stack top is: 0In tail call version, the stack top is: 0In tail call version, the stack top is: 0In tail call version, the stack top is: 0120In normal call version, the stack top is: 0In normal call version, the stack top is: 0In normal call version, the stack top is: 0In normal call version, the stack top is: 0In normal call version, the stack top is: 0120 Not only it tail call optimized the first, it also tail call optimized the second! Why doesn't g++ do tail call optimization while its clearly available in the platform? is there any way to force it?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Because you're passing a temporary std::string object to the PrintStackTop(std::string) function. This object is allocated on the stack and thus prevent the tail call optimization. I modified your code: void PrintStackTopStr(char const*const type){    int stack_top;    if(st == 0) st = (size_t) &stack_top;    cout << ""In "" << type << "" call version, the stack top is: "" << (st - (size_t) &stack_top) << endl;}int RealTailCallFactorial(int n, int a = 1){    PrintStackTopStr(""tail"");    if(n < 2)        return a;    return RealTailCallFactorial(n - 1, n * a);} Compile with: g++ -O2 -fno-exceptions -o tailcall tailcall.cpp And it now uses the tail call optimisation.

","The Java operators & , | and ^ are EITHER bitwise operators OR logical operators ... depending on the types of the operands.  If the operands are integers, the operators are bitwise.  If they are booleans, then the operators are logical. And this is not just me saying this.  The JLS describes these operators this way too; see JLS 15.22 . (This is just like + meaning EITHER addition OR string concatenation ... depending on the types of the operands.  Or just like a ""rose"" meaning either a flower or a shower attachment.  Or ""cat"" meaning either a furry animal or a UNIX command.  Words mean different things in different contexts.  And this is true for the symbols used in programming languages too.) There are already logical operators && , || , why use & , | , ^ ?

The two different semantics are needed in different situations; e.g. boolean res = str != null && str.isEmpty(); versus boolean res = foo() & bar();  // ... if I >>need<< to call both methods.

","Just to be clear, the following is valid Python code: def foo(bar1, bar2, bar3=None, bar4=1): print(""bar1=""+str(bar1)+"" bar2=""+str(bar2)+"" bar3=""+str(bar3)+"" bar4=""+str(bar4))x=[1,7]y={'bar3':True, 'bar4':9}foo(*x,**y) However, there is no analogous Scala syntax.  There are some similar things, but the main reason this is never going to be possible is that it would violate the compile-time type checking that Scala requires.  Let's look more closely. The reasons First, think about the varargs portion.  Here you want to be able to pass in an arbitrary-length list of arguments and have it fill in the relevant function parameters.  This will never work in Scala because the type checker requires that the parameters passed into a function be valid.  In your scenario, foo() can accept a parameter list x of length two, but no less.  But since any Seq can have an arbitrary number of parameters, how would the type checker know that the x being pass it is valid at compile time? Second, think about the keywword arguments.  Here you are asking for the function to accept an arbitrary Map of arguments and values.  But you get the same problem: How can the compile-time type checker know that you are passing in all of the necessary arguments?  Or, further, that they are the right types?  After all, they example you give is a Map containing both a Boolean and an Int, which would have the type Map[String, Any] , so how would the type checker know that this would match your parameter types? Some solutions Scala's varargs You can do some similar things, but not this exactly.  For example, if you defined your function to explicitly use varargs, you can pass in a Seq: def foo(bar1: Int*) = println(f""bar1=$bar1"")val x = Seq(1, 2)foo(x:_*) This works because Scala knows that it only needs a sequence of zero or more arguments, and a Seq will always contain zero or more items, so it matches.  Further, it only works if the types match as well; here it's expecting a sequence of Ints, and gets it. tupled The other thing you can do is to pass in a tuple of arguments: def foo(bar1: Int, bar2: Int, bar3: Boolean = false, bar4: Int = 1) = println(f""bar1=$bar1 bar2=$bar2 bar3=$bar3 bar4=$bar4"")val x = (1, 2, true, 9)(foo _).tupled(x) Again, this works because Scala's type checker can verify that the arguments are valid.  The function requires four arguments, of types Int, Int, Boolean, and Int, and since a tuple in Scala has a fixed length and known (and possibly different) types for each position, the type-checker can verify that the arguments match the expected parameters.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/20731098', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/565968/']}",jdg_360771

Question:
Being fascinated by the approximation $$\sin(x) \simeq \frac{16 (\pi -x) x}{5 \pi ^2-4 (\pi -x) x}\qquad (0\leq x\leq\pi)$$  proposed, more than 1400 years ago by Mahabhaskariya of Bhaskara I (a seventh-century Indian mathematician) (see here ), I considered the function $$\sin \left(\frac{1}{2} \left(\pi -\sqrt{\pi ^2-4 y}\right)\right)$$ which I expanded as a Taylor series around $y=0$. This gives $$\sin \left(\frac{1}{2} \left(\pi -\sqrt{\pi ^2-4 y}\right)\right)=\frac{y}{\pi }+\frac{y^2}{\pi ^3}+\left(\frac{2}{\pi ^5}-\frac{1}{6 \pi ^3}\right)   y^3+O\left(y^4\right)$$ Now, I made (and may be, this is not allowed) $y=(\pi-x)x$. Replacing, I obtain$$\sin(x)=\frac{(\pi -x) x}{\pi }+\frac{(\pi -x)^2 x^2}{\pi ^3}+\left(\frac{2}{\pi ^5}-\frac{1}{6 \pi ^3}\right) (\pi -x)^3 x^3+\cdots$$ I did not add the $O\left(.\right)$ on purpose since not feeeling very comfortable. What is really beautiful is that the last expansion matches almost exactly the function $\sin(x)$ for the considered range $(0\leq x\leq\pi)$ and it can be very useful for easy and simple approximate evaluations of definite integrals such as$$I_a(x)=\int_0^x \frac{\sin(t)}{t^a}\,dt$$ under the conditions $(0\leq x\leq \pi)$ and $a<2$. I could do the same with the simplest Padé approximant and obtain $$\sin(x)\approx \frac{(\pi -x) x}{\pi  \left(1-\frac{(\pi -x) x}{\pi ^2}\right)}=\frac{5\pi(\pi -x) x}{5\pi ^2-5(\pi -x) x}$$ which, for sure, is far to be as good as the magnificent approximation given at the beginning of the post but which is not very very bad (except around $x=\frac \pi 2$). The problem is that I am not sure that I have the right of doing things like that. I would greatly appreciate if you could tell me what I am doing wrong and/or illegal using such an approach. Edit After robjohn's answer and recommendations, I improved the approximation writing as an approximant $$f_n(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \big(\pi-x)x\big)^i$$ and minimized $$S_n=\int_0^\pi\big(\sin(x)-f_n(x)\big)^2$$ with respect to the $a_i$'s. What is obtained is $$a_1=\frac{60480 \left(4290-484 \pi ^2+5 \pi ^4\right)}{\pi ^9} \approx 0.31838690$$ $$a_2=-\frac{166320 \left(18720-2104 \pi ^2+21 \pi ^4\right)}{\pi ^{11}}\approx 0.03208100$$ $$a_3=\frac{720720 \left(11880-1332 \pi ^2+13 \pi ^4\right)}{\pi ^{13}}\approx 0.00127113$$ These values are not very far from those given by Taylor ($\approx 0.31830989$), ($\approx 0.03225153$), ($\approx 0.00116027$) but, as shown below, they change very drastically the results. The errors oscillate above and below the zero line and, for the considered range, are all smaller than $10^{-5}$. After minimization, $S_3\approx 8.67\times 10^{-11}$ while, for the above Taylor series, it was $\approx 6.36\times 10^{-7}$.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","A few approximations When making approximations, there is no legal or illegal. There are things that work better and things that don't. When making approximations that are supposed to work over a large range of values, often the plain Taylor series is not the best way to go. Instead, a polynomial or rational function that matches the function at a number of points is better.$$\frac{\pi(\pi-x)x}{\pi^2-\left(4-\pi\right)(\pi-x)x}\tag{1}$$matches the values and slopes of $\sin(x)$ at $0$, $\frac\pi2$, and $\pi$. However, it is always low.

Question:
Suppose that $\left\{B\left(t\right): t \geq 0\right\}$ is a Brownian motion and $U$ is an independent random variable, which is uniformly distributed on $\left[0,1\right]$. Then the process $\left\{\tilde{B}\left(t\right): t \geq 0\right\}$ defined by  $$\tilde{B}\left(t\right) :=\begin{cases}B\left(t\right), & \textrm{if } t \neq U, \\0, & \textrm{if } t = U\end{cases}$$  has the same finite-dimensional distributions as a Brownian motion, but is discontinuous if $B\left(U\right) \neq 0$, i.e. with probability one, and hence this process is not a Brownian motion. This is Example 1.2, p. 8, from Mörters & Peres's ""Brownian Motion"" (the version that's available on Peres's website). I don't understand why the event $\left\{B\left(U\right) \neq 0\right\}$ has probability one. I'll appreciate any help.

Question:
I have seen many programs consisting of structures like the one below typedef struct {    int i;    char k;} elem;elem user; Why is it needed so often? Any specific reason or applicable area?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As Greg Hewgill said, the typedef means you no longer have to write struct all over the place. That not only saves keystrokes, it also can make the code cleaner since it provides a smidgen more abstraction. Stuff like typedef struct {  int x, y;} Point;Point point_new(int x, int y){  Point a;  a.x = x;  a.y = y;  return a;} becomes cleaner when you don't need to see the ""struct"" keyword all over the place, it looks more as if there really is a type called ""Point"" in your language. Which, after the typedef , is the case I guess. Also note that while your example (and mine) omitted naming the struct itself, actually naming it is also useful for when you want to provide an opaque type. Then you'd have code like this in the header, for instance: typedef struct Point Point;Point * point_new(int x, int y); and then provide the struct definition in the implementation file: struct Point{  int x, y;};Point * point_new(int x, int y){  Point *p;  if((p = malloc(sizeof *p)) != NULL)  {    p->x = x;    p->y = y;  }  return p;} In this latter case, you cannot return the Point by value, since its definition is hidden from users of the header file. This is a technique used widely in GTK+ , for instance. UPDATE Note that there are also highly-regarded C projects where this use of typedef to hide struct is considered a bad idea, the Linux kernel is probably the most well-known such project. See Chapter 5 of The Linux Kernel CodingStyle document for Linus' angry words. :) My point is that the ""should"" in the question is perhaps not set in stone, after all.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 10, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/252780', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/31116/']}",jdg_112632

Question:
I was reading through section 5.7 of the second edition of Sutton and Barto's ""Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction"" when I came across this passage: where the ""method"" that the author is referring to is the incremental, every-visit implementation for Off-Policy MC Control with weighted importance sampling covered earlier in the section and provided here for reference: My question is this: why does the method above only learn from the tails of the episode, as the author suggests in the excerpt? After searching around a bit, the only relevant link I could find online was here: http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/first/5/node7.html which is an online version of the first edition of the text. An excerpt from this link clarifies that what the author means by ""the tails of episodes"" is in fact ""after the last nongreedy action."" However, I still fail to see why all of the remaining actions after some point in an episode are guaranteed to be greedy, or how these greedy actions belong to the only time steps from which the above method can learn.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I still fail to see why all of the remaining actions after some point in an episode are guaranteed to be greedy, It is not the case, there is no guarantee of any number of steps being greedy. The very last step can be non-greedy. In that case, then the only return that will get assessed in off-policy Monte Carlo control is for $S_{T-1}, A_{T-1}$ . That step does get processed (and in general the last exploratory step in any trajectory), because you don't apply importance sampling to the action in the $Q(s,a)$ that is being updated. In general, there will be a number of steps prior to the end of the episode where the behaviour policy took an action that was valid in the target policy. The number will be anything from 0 to the length of the entire episode. Distribution of this number depends on the overlap between behaviour policy and target policy. An $\epsilon$ -greedy behaviour policy learning a greedy target policy may have relatively long series where the actions are greedy, depending on value of $\epsilon$ . or how these greedy actions belong to the only time steps from which the above method can learn This is due to weighted importance sampling. The importance sampling ratio, applied on each time step with target policy $\pi$ and behaviour policy $b$ is: $$\frac{\pi(a|s)}{b(a|s)}$$ If the target policy is the greedy policy over current $Q(s,a)$ (which it is in the given Monte Carlo Control algorithm), then any exploration will insert a multiplication by 0 into the importance sampling ratio (because $\pi(a|s)=0$ for exploring actions), making the adjusted return estimate zero regardless of any other values. In addition, the weighting when taking the mean also uses this factor, so there will be no change to any $(s,a)$ pair with a later exploratory action. If you used non-weighted importance sampling, then in theory you do need to add these zeros into the mean Q estimates, because the denominator for the average return is the number of visits to each $(s,a)$ . This adding of zeroes counters the over-estimates made when the trajectory from that point on is greedy (and multiplied by a factor of $\frac{1}{(1-\epsilon + \frac{\epsilon}{|\mathcal{A}|})^{T-t-1}}$ for example if you are using $\epsilon$ -greedy). In a sense then it is Monte Carlo Control with weighted importance sampling which has this limitation (of only learning from tails of episodes). However, un-weighted importance sampling is not learning much, it is just learning a correction to its over-estimates elsewhere. And in general weighted importance sampling is preferred due to lower variance.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/358047', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/215007/']}",jdg_87848

Possible Duplicate: Why doesn't C have unsigned floats? The question is probably very basic and probably answered many time earlier, but I want to understand why C++ does not have unsigned floating point types, even though floating point literals can be signed or unsigned. $3.9.1/8- ""There are three floating  point types: float, double, and long  double.""

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Unsigned integer types have two important properties that differentiate them from signed integer types: ""shifted"" range (no negative subrange, but positive subrange twice as wide) and modulo arithmetic. For integer types these properties are important enough to justify the existence of unsigned types. With floating-types neither of these properties are immediately applicable. With floating-point types the main issue is not in their range (for many purposes it can be thought of as virtually infinite), but rather in precision. And modulo arithmetic is not naturally applicable to non-integer types. For this reason, it didn't make much sense to introduce unsigned floating-point types, i.e. it didn't make much sense to flip-flop the role of just one bit in the floating-point representation. It should also be noted that the above reasoning should probably be used as rationale behind introducing unsigned integer types (and not introducing unsigned floating-point types) in popular hardware and corresponding hardware-derived standards. What we have in C and C++ was essentially inherited from the hardware capabilities and these standards. Of course, from the conceptual point if view, it would be quite logical to have unsigned floating-point types in the language, just for the sake of consistency.

Question:
When we deal with Special Relativity and we start considering spacetime instead of space and time each at once, we usually see books saying that we consider a space with four coordinate $x^\alpha$ with $x^0 = ct$.

","But that's exactly the deeper meaning! Setting things up so that all coordinates are in the same units (besides being a reasonable requirement for $x^\mu$ to be considered a four-vector) is a constant reminder that time is really not that different from space. In fact, if it weren't for that sign in the metric, spacetime would be completely symmetric in its coordinates. This is made even more apparent when we switch to a system of units in which $c = 1$.

Question:
In a recent talk Finite groups, yesterday and today Serre made some comments about proofs that rely on the classification of finite simple groups (CFSG) and on the ATLAS of Finite Groups . Namely, he said that a proof that relied on the CFSG and said so was ok, but a proof that relied on the ATLAS was not so ok, because the content has not been completely independently verified, and has as its basis old computer and other calculations that have only been done once. Given that (numerous?) little errors have been found over time , it would be good to have a definitive record as to which bits have either been calculated or proved elsewhere, or formally verified in the case of the computer calculations, and if so where and by whom (with code for the latter case). Note that merely being able to do some calculations in GAP is not quite enough, since, as the documentation says Part of the constructions have been documented in the literature on almost simple groups, or the results have been used in such publications, see for example the references in [CCNPW85] and [BN95]. where CCNPW85 is the ATLAS and BN95 is Breuer and Norton's Improvements to the Atlas (in an appendix of Atlas of Brauer Characters ). EDIT Since it may not have been clear, I was after statements modeled on the following: ""All results about classical groups of Lie type are well-known and documented elsewhere"" ""All results about conjugacy classes of the sporadic groups except Janko 4 [say] are calculated afresh and contained in X computer package"" ""The results on [blah] about [some group] are only contained in the ATLAS, and no papers or independently written software have reproved/recalculated them"" If it's easier to specify what is only in the ATLAS then that would be good, since clearly a lot of the classical material would be known and calculated long before. EDIT May 2017 In a recent talk ( 50 years ago: a great time for number theory — the first few minutes only before the main talk) Serre mentions his comments discussed here, the fact people got worked up about it, and the paper Breuer, Malle, and O'Brien - Reliability and reproducibility of Atlas information in Farrokh Shirjian's answer , which he feels addresses his complaints.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Unlike Dima, I am inclined to agree with Serre on this point. Although most of the facts recorded in the ATLAS have been proved elsewhere or, in the case of all of the character tables except for those of the very large groups like the Monster, can be easily recomputed in GAP or Magma using standard algorithms for finite groups, it can be very difficult in some cases to track down alternative proofs. I have recently completed a book (co-authored with John Bray and Colva Roney-Dougal) calculating complete lists of maximal subgroups of almost simple classical groups in dimensions up to $12$, and we were confronted with this problem. Although we cited the ATLAS many times, we tried hard to provide alternative citations or, for facts that could be easily checked by computer, we provided code to do this. In fact nearly all of the facts we required were either about maximal subgroups of groups in the ATLAS or involved entries in character tables. For the sporadic groups there were virtually always alternative papers to cite, which were generally also cited in the ATLAS. We had more difficulties with things like maximal subgroups of almost simple extensions of some of the more complicated classical groups in the ATLAS, like $U_4(3)$. For these we could not always find alternative sources that gave precise enough information, and we were told informally that some of the information had been originally  calculated by unidentified research students or PostDocs. So we tried hard to re-prove these facts. Having said that, we found remarkably few errors in the ATLAS. I think there might have been one or two very small and minor inaccuracies in some of the structure descriptions, which we reported to the authors, and I think they might have known about them already. I see that there is an ""ATLAS 30 Years On"" conference coming up in Princeton in November 2015, so perhaps this will lead to more discusssion of these questions. I should also reinforce the point made by David Roberts that one needs to be very cautious when using Computer Algebra Systems, such as GAP and Magma, to verify facts contained in sources like the ATLAS, because it is possible that the code used is itself relying on these sources. For example $\mathtt{ MaximalSubgroups}$ in Magma will generally look up the maximal subgroups of the group's composition factors in a database, which will have been constructed using the ATLAS. However, a default use of $\mathtt{CharacterTable}$ on a finite group will use a general purpose algorithm (such as Dixon-Schneider), which does not rely on properties of specific (simple) groups.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/215102', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/4177/']}",jdg_241383

Question:
I want to take Input from the user as Big-Integer and manipulate it into  a For loop BigInteger i;for(BigInteger i=0; i<=100000; i++) {    System.out.println(i);} But it won't work can any body help me.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You use these syntax instead: BigInteger i = BigInteger.valueOf(100000L);  // long i = 100000L;i.compareTo(BigInteger.ONE) > 0              // i > 1i = i.subtract(BigInteger.ONE)               // i = i - 1 So here's an example of putting it together: for (BigInteger bi = BigInteger.valueOf(5);            bi.compareTo(BigInteger.ZERO) > 0;            bi = bi.subtract(BigInteger.ONE)) {        System.out.println(bi);    }    // prints ""5"", ""4"", ""3"", ""2"", ""1"" Note that using BigInteger as a loop index is highly atypical. long is usually enough for this purpose. API links java.math.BigInteger int compareTo(BigInteger val) from interface Comparable<T> BigInteger subtract(BigInteger val) BigInteger add(BigInteger val) static BigInteger valueOf(long val) The compareTo idiom From the documentation: This method is provided in preference to individual methods for each of the six boolean comparison operators ( < , == , > , >= , != , <= ). The suggested idiom for performing these comparisons is: ( x.compareTo(y) <op> 0 ), where <op> is one of the six comparison operators. In other words, given BigInteger x, y , these are the comparison idioms: x.compareTo(y) <  0     // x <  yx.compareTo(y) <= 0     // x <= yx.compareTo(y) != 0     // x != yx.compareTo(y) == 0     // x == yx.compareTo(y) >  0     // x >  yx.compareTo(y) >= 0     // x >= y This is not specific to BigInteger ; this is applicable to any Comparable<T> in general. Note on immutability BigInteger , like String , is an immutable object. Beginners tend to make the following mistake: String s = ""  hello  "";s.trim(); // doesn't ""work""!!!BigInteger bi = BigInteger.valueOf(5);bi.add(BigInteger.ONE); // doesn't ""work""!!! Since they're immutable, these methods don't mutate the objects they're invoked on, but instead return new objects, the results of those operations. Thus, the correct usage is something like: s = s.trim();bi = bi.add(BigInteger.ONE);",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3024186', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/293436/']}",jdg_245090

Question:
I am writing a memory profiler for C and for that am intercepting calls to the malloc , realloc and free functions via malloc_hooks. Unfortunately, these are deprecated because of their poor behavior in multi threaded environments. I could not find a document describing the alternative best practice solution to achieve the same thing, can someone enlighten me? I've read that a simple #define malloc(s) malloc_hook(s) would do the trick, but that does not work with the system setup I have in mind, because it is too intrusive to the original code base to be suitable for use in a profiling / tracing tool. Having to manually change the original application code is a killer for any decent profiler. Optimally, the solution I am looking for should be enabled or disabled just by linking to an optional shared library. For example, my current setup uses a function declared with __attribute__ ((constructor)) to install the intercepting malloc hooks. Thanks

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","After trying some things, I finally managed to figure out how to do this. First of all, in glibc , malloc is defined as a weak symbol, which means that it can be overwritten by the application or a shared library. Hence, LD_PRELOAD is not necessarily needed. Instead, I implemented the following function in a shared library: void*malloc (size_t size){  [ ... ]} Which gets called by the application instead of glibc s malloc . Now, to be equivalent to the __malloc_hook s functionality, a couple of things are still missing. 1.) the caller address In addition to the original parameters to malloc , glibc s __malloc_hook s also provide the address of the calling function, which is actually the return address of where malloc would return to. To achieve the same thing, we can use the __builtin_return_address function that is available in gcc. I have not looked into other compilers, because I am limited to gcc anyway, but if you happen to know how to do such a thing portably, please drop me a comment :) Our malloc function now looks like this: void*malloc (size_t size){  void *caller = __builtin_return_address(0);  [ ... ]} 2.) accessing glibc s malloc from within your hook As I am limited to glibc in my application, I chose to use __libc_malloc to access the original malloc implementation. Alternatively, dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, ""malloc"") can be used, but at the possible pitfall that this function uses calloc on its first call, possibly resulting in an infinite loop leading to a segfault. complete malloc hook My complete hooking function now looks like this: extern void *__libc_malloc(size_t size);int malloc_hook_active = 0;void*malloc (size_t size){  void *caller = __builtin_return_address(0);  if (malloc_hook_active)    return my_malloc_hook(size, caller);  return __libc_malloc(size);} where my_malloc_hook looks like this: void*my_malloc_hook (size_t size, void *caller){  void *result;  // deactivate hooks for logging  malloc_hook_active = 0;  result = malloc(size);  // do logging  [ ... ]  // reactivate hooks  malloc_hook_active = 1;  return result;} Of course, the hooks for calloc , realloc and free work similarly. dynamic and static linking With these functions, dynamic linking works out of the box. Linking the .so file containing the malloc hook implementation will result of all calls to malloc from the application and also all library calls to be routed through my hook. Static linking is problematic though. I have not yet wrapped my head around it completely, but in static linking malloc is not a weak symbol, resulting in a multiple definition error at link time. If you need static linking for whatever reason, for example translating function addresses in 3rd party libraries to code lines via debug symbols, then you can link these 3rd party libs statically while still linking the malloc hooks dynamically, avoiding the multiple definition problem. I have not yet found a better workaround for this, if you know one,feel free to leave me a comment. Here is a short example: gcc -o test test.c -lmalloc_hook_library -Wl,-Bstatic -l3rdparty -Wl,-Bdynamic 3rdparty will be linked statically, while malloc_hook_library will be linked dynamically, resulting in the expected behaviour, and addresses of functions in 3rdparty to be translatable via debug symbols in test . Pretty neat, huh? Conlusion the techniques above describe a non-deprecated, pretty much equivalent approach to __malloc_hook s, but with a couple of mean limitations: __builtin_caller_address only works with gcc __libc_malloc only works with glibc dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, [...]) is a GNU extension in glibc the linker flags -Wl,-Bstatic and -Wl,-Bdynamic are specific to the GNU binutils. In other words, this solution is utterly non-portable and alternative solutions would have to be added if the hooks library were to be ported to a non-GNU operating system.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/17803456', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/885605/']}",jdg_315911

Question:
Here's the contents of the remote and branch sections of my .git/config file. [remote ""origin""]      url = https://EvanAad@bitbucket.org/EvanAad/bitbucketstationlocations.git      fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*  [branch ""master""]      remote = origin      merge = refs/heads/master What is the meaning and purpose of the contents of these sections, in particular the fetch and merge subsections? How is this information used by Git to guide its operation?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Its called refspec.Its the mechmism that git is using to ""talk"" to the remote server and to map local branches to remote branches. Refspecs A refspec maps a branch in the local repository to a branch in a remote repository. This makes it possible to manage remote branches using local Git commands and to configure some advanced git push and git fetch behavior. A refspec is specified as [+]<src>:<dst> . The <src> parameter is the source branch in the local repository, and the <dst> parameter is the destination branch in the remote repository. The optional + sign is for forcing the remote repository to perform a non-fast-forward update . Refspecs can be used with the git push command to give a different name to the remote branch. For example, the following command pushes the master branch to the origin remote repo like an ordinary git push, but it uses qa-master as the name for the branch in the origin repo. This is useful for QA teams that need to push their own branches to a remote repo. git push origin master:refs/heads/qa-master By adding a few lines to the Git configuration file, you can use refspecs to alter the behavior of git fetch. By default, git fetch fetches all of the branches in the remote repository. The reason for this is the following section of the .git/config file: [remote ""origin""]    url = https://git@github.com:mary/example-repo.git    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* The fetch line tells git fetch to download all of the branches from the origin repo. But, some workflows don’t need all of them. For example, many continuous integration workflows only care about the master branch. To fetch only the master branch, change the fetch line to match the following: [remote ""origin""]    url = https://git@github.com:mary/example-repo.git    fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master You can also configure git push in a similar manner. For instance, if you want to always push the master branch to qa-master in the origin remote (as we did above), you would change the config file to: [remote ""origin""]    url = https://git@github.com:mary/example-repo.git    fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master    push = refs/heads/master:refs/heads/qa-master Refspecs give you complete control over how various Git commands transfer branches between repositories . They let you rename and delete branches from your local repository, fetch/push to branches with different names, and configure git push and git fetch to work with only the branches that you want.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/43317872', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1818935/']}",jdg_166195

Question:
One I am aware of is Perl::Critic And my googling has resulted in no results on multiple attempts so far. :-( Does anyone have any recommendations here? Any resources to configure Perl::Critic as per our coding standards and run it on code base would be appreciated.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","In terms of setting up a profile, have you tried perlcritic --profile-proto ?  This will emit to stdout all of your installed policies with all their options with descriptions of both, including their default values, in perlcriticrc format.  Save and edit to match what you want. Whenever you upgrade Perl::Critic, you may want to run this command again and do a diff with your current perlcriticrc so you can see any changes to existing policies and pick up any new ones. In terms of running perlcritic regularly, set up a Test::Perl::Critic test along with the rest of your tests. This is good for new code. For your existing code, use Test::Perl::Critic::Progressive instead. T::P::C::Progressive will succeed the first time you run it, but will save counts on the number of violations; thereafter, T::P::C::Progressive will complain if any of the counts go up. One thing to look out for is when you revert changes in your source control system. (You are using one, aren't you?) Say I check in a change and run tests and my changes reduce the number of P::C violations. Later, it turns out my change was bad, so I revert to the old code. The T::P::C::Progressive test will fail due to the reduced counts. The easiest thing to do at this point is to just delete the history file (default location t/.perlcritic-history) and run again. It should reproduce your old counts and you can write new stuff to bring them down again. Perl::Critic has a lot of policies that ship with it, but there are a bunch of add-on distributions of policies. Have a look at Task::Perl::Critic and Task::Perl::Critic::IncludingOptionalDependencies . You don't need to have a single perlcriticrc handle all your code. Create separate perlcriticrc files for each set of files you want to test and then a separate test that points to each one. For an example, have a look at the author tests for P::C itself at http://perlcritic.tigris.org/source/browse/perlcritic/trunk/Perl-Critic/xt/author/ . When author tests are run, there's a test that runs over all the code of P::C, a second test that applies additional rules just on the policies, and a third one that criticizes P::C's tests. I personally think that everyone should run at the ""brutal"" severity level, but knock out the policies that they don't agree with. Perl::Critic isn't entirely self compliant; even the P::C developers don't agree with everything Conway says. Look at the perlcriticrc files used on Perl::Critic itself and search the Perl::Critic code for instances of ""## no critic""; I count 143 at present.

","Html.Raw() returns IHtmlString , not the ordinary string . So, you cannot write them in opposite sides of : operator. Remove that .ToString() calling @{int count = 0;}@foreach (var item in Model.Resources){    @(count <= 3 ?

","BeanFactory has a getBean(String name, Object... args) method which, according to the javadoc , allows you to specify constructor arguments which are used to override the bean definition's own arguments.

","INNER JOIN is ANSI syntax that you should use. It is generally considered more readable, especially when you join lots of tables.

","The way logging is configured has changed a little... The recommended way (and it's pretty well documented in this GitHub issue/announcement to do it now is to configure the loggers on the AddLogging method, such as services.AddLogging(builder =>{    builder.AddConfiguration(Configuration.GetSection(""Logging""))        .AddConsole()        .AddDebug();}); And have an appsettings.json like Notice Seems a few people are confused, because the example only demonstrates the configuration of Console provider and not all loggers. The LogLevel section configures logging level for all namespaces ( Default key) or for a specific namespace ( System overrides the default value for all classes logging whose namespace starts with System.* . This is for the class used in T in ILogger<T> ). This allows to set a higher or lower than default logging level for loggers from this namespace. {  ""ApplicationInsights"": {    ""InstrumentationKey"": """"  },  ""Logging"": {    ""IncludeScopes"": false,    ""LogLevel"": {      ""Default"": ""Information"",      ""System"": ""Warning"",      ""Microsoft"": ""Information""    },    ""Console"": {      ""LogLevel"": {        ""Default"": ""Warning"",        ""System"": ""Information"",        ""Microsoft"": ""Information""      }    }  }} Please note that the structure of the appsettings.json changed from what it used to be in .NET Core 1.x and that Logging entry in the appsettings.json now has logger provider names in it, which allows you to configure logging levels per logging provider. Previously, the entry in appsettings.json would only be applicable to the console logger. Alternatively, the logging can now be moved within the WebHostBuilder instead. public static void Main(){    var host = new WebHostBuilder()        .UseKestrel()        .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())        .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>        {            var env = hostingContext.HostingEnvironment;            config.AddJsonFile(""appsettings.json"", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)                .AddJsonFile($""appsettings.{env.EnvironmentName}.json"", optional: true)                .AddJsonFile(""hosting.json"", optional: false)                .AddEnvironmentVariables();        })        .ConfigureLogging((webhostContext, builder) => {            builder.AddConfiguration(webhostContext.Configuration.GetSection(""Logging""))            .AddConsole()            .AddDebug();        })        .UseIISIntegration()        .UseStartup<Startup>()        .UseApplicationInsights()        .Build();    host.Run();} Update In case one doesn't want to use the appsettings.json , one can register the filters in code too. services.AddLogging(builder =>{    builder.AddConfiguration(Configuration.GetSection(""Logging""))        // filter for all providers        .AddFilter(""System"", LogLevel.Debug)        // Only for Debug logger, using the provider type or it's alias        .AddFilter(""Debug"", ""System"", LogLevel.Information)        // Only for Console logger by provider type        .AddFilter<DebugLoggerProvider>(""System"", LogLevel.Error)        .AddConsole()        .AddDebug();});",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/45781873', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/26049/']}",jdg_313003

Below is a question asked on the forum mathoverflow.net. Provide a good and informational response to it like a helpful human would.

Question:
Zeroth question - am I right that in the ""ordinary"" sense an abelian variety does not possess any representations at all? More precisely, a representation of an algebraic group $G$ (over an algebraically closed field $K$ , say, over complex numbers) is a homomorphism $G\to\operatorname{GL}(V)$ for some $K$ -vector space $V$ , which is a morphism of algebraic varieties. I have vague feeling that if $G$ is a projective variety, hence an abelian variety, then there are no nontrivial such homomorphisms. If the answer to this zeroth question is negative, then my actual (""number one"") question would be whether there is a classification of such representations. (As @Wojowu explains in a comment below, this is indeed true) If it is positive, then the question is whether there exists a modification of the notion of representation that would give some meaningful result - mostly, would allow studying an abelian variety $G$ through such representations. Possible approaches would, maybe, include allowing ""representations with singularities"", say, instead of polynomial homomorphisms to allow rational homomorphisms $G\to\operatorname{GL}(V)$ . Or, say, one might consider $G$ -equivariant vector bundles over $G$ (whatever this means). Or, one might look at algebraic homomorphisms $G\to\operatorname{Aut}(A)$ where $A$ is some commutative ""thing"" in $K$ -varieties such that the algebraic group $\operatorname{Aut}(A)$ admits nontrivial algebraic homomorphisms from abelian varieties to it. Subquestion: are there such $A$ ? Can it be, say, another abelian variety? Maybe one more hopefully simpler subquestion. Let $\operatorname{Aut}(|G|)$ be the algebraic group of all algebraic automorphisms of the underlying algebraic variety $|G|$ of $G$ . Then (presumably) the map assigning to $x\in G$ the multiplication-by- $x$ operator $G\to G$ is an injective algebraic homomorphism $G\to\operatorname{Aut}(|G|)$ , so $\operatorname{Aut}(|G|)$ contains a copy of $G$ as a subgroup. What are, if any, subgroups in between? How does $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ sit inside $\operatorname{Aut}(|G|)$ ? Is this $\operatorname{Aut}(|G|)$ studied somewhere?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I am also very far from an expert here, but I think there's a case to be made that the ""correct notion"" involves actions on categories of sheaves, as Donu says in the comments. Consider the following toy model: if $A$ is, say, a finite abelian group then its Pontryagin dual $\widehat{A}$ can be defined as the group $\text{Hom}(A, \mathbb{G}_m)$ of homomorphisms from $A$ into the multiplicative group $\mathbb{G}_m$ (say over the complex numbers, so $\mathbb{G}_m(\mathbb{C}) \cong \mathbb{C}^{\times}$ , but any algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ would do, or we could think in terms of Cartier duality). There is then a canonical pairing $$A \times \widehat{A} \to \mathbb{G}_m$$ which is used, for example, to define the Fourier transform $L^2(A) \cong L^2(\widehat{A})$ . In representation-theoretic terms these homomorphisms correspond to $1$ -dimensional representations and give exactly the irreducible representations of $A$ . Abelian varieties $X$ also have duals $X^{\vee}$ , but they're defined not in terms of maps into the multiplicative group $\mathbb{G}_m$ but in terms of line bundles, or equivalently in terms of maps into the classifying stack $B\mathbb{G}_m$ of line bundles (although we need to restrict to degree $0$ line bundles). There is again a canonical ""pairing"" $$X \times X^{\vee} \to B \mathbb{G}_m,$$ namely the Poincaré bundle over $X \times X^{\vee}$ , and it can be used to define the Fourier-Mukai transform $D(X) \cong D(X^{\vee})$ between derived categories of coherent sheaves. Among other things, what this analogy suggests is that the analogue of the ""regular representation"" for an abelian variety is its action on its derived category $D(X)$ by translation.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/371786', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/41291/']}",jdg_341331

Does it make sense to store user's FB access token in DB to post to wall later or is the access token relatively short-lived? Here's an example situation that might happen in my app:user clicks fb button, authorizes my app, gets redirected back to my site where I automatically create an account based on data provided by FB, also I store user's FB ID so that I could sign in this user later. Now he browses site, enters some info and this info gets posted to his wall. Everything is fine so far because user's browser holds the cookie created by FB. Now user leaves the site and contacts site admin. Admin opens his own browser, goes to admin interface and posts something on behalf of this user. Now, having that user's FB ID and assuming that user hasn't revoked permissions, can I still post this to his wall?

To get it, call : if ($user) {    $token = $facebook->getAccessToken();    // store token} Use the offline access token To use the offline access token when the user is not logged in : require ""facebook.php"";$facebook = new Facebook(array(  'appId'  => YOUR_APP_ID,  'secret' => YOUR_APP_SECRET,));$facebook->setAccessToken(""...""); And now you can make API calls for this user : $user_profile = $facebook->api('/me'); Hope that helps !",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/4608713', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/220474/']}",jdg_339310

Question:
Let's say that I have a lot of similar data classes. Here's an example class User which is defined as follows: case class User (name: String, age: Int, posts: List[String]) {  val numPosts: Int = posts.length  ...  def foo = ""bar""  ...} I am interested in automatically creating a method ( at compile time ) that returns a Map in a way that each field name is mapped to its value when it is called in runtime. For the example above, let's say that my method is called toMap : val myUser = User(""Foo"", 25, List(""Lorem"", ""Ipsum""))myUser.toMap should return Map(""name"" -> ""Foo"", ""age"" -> 25, ""posts"" -> List(""Lorem"", ""Ipsum""), ""numPosts"" -> 2) How would you do this with macros? Here's what I have done: First, I created a Model class as a superclass for all of my data classes and implemented the method in there like this: abstract class Model {  def toMap[T]: Map[String, Any] = macro toMap_impl[T]}class User(...) extends Model {  ...} Then I defined a macro implementation in a separate Macros object: object Macros {  import scala.language.experimental.macros  import scala.reflect.macros.Context  def getMap_impl[T: c.WeakTypeTag](c: Context): c.Expr[Map[String, Any]] = {    import c.universe._    val tpe = weakTypeOf[T]    // Filter members that start with ""value"", which are val fields    val members = tpe.members.toList.filter(m => !m.isMethod && m.toString.startsWith(""value""))    // Create (""fieldName"", field) tuples to construct a map from field names to fields themselves    val tuples =      for {        m <- members        val fieldString = Literal(Constant(m.toString.replace(""value "", """")))        val field = Ident(m)      } yield (fieldString, field)    val mappings = tuples.toMap    /* Parse the string version of the map [i.e. Map(""posts"" -> (posts), ""age"" -> (age), ""name"" -> (name))] to get the AST     * for the map, which is generated as:     *      * Apply(Ident(newTermName(""Map"")),      *   List(     *     Apply(Select(Literal(Constant(""posts"")), newTermName(""$minus$greater"")), List(Ident(newTermName(""posts"")))),      *     Apply(Select(Literal(Constant(""age"")), newTermName(""$minus$greater"")), List(Ident(newTermName(""age"")))),      *     Apply(Select(Literal(Constant(""name"")), newTermName(""$minus$greater"")), List(Ident(newTermName(""name""))))     *   )     * )     *      * which is equivalent to Map(""posts"".$minus$greater(posts), ""age"".$minus$greater(age), ""name"".$minus$greater(name))      */    c.Expr[Map[String, Any]](c.parse(mappings.toString))  }} Yet I get this error from sbt when I try to compile it: [error] /Users/emre/workspace/DynamoReflection/core/src/main/scala/dynamo/Main.scala:9: not found: value posts[error]     foo.getMap[User][error]               ^ Macros.scala is being compiled first. Here is the snippet from my Build.scala: lazy val root: Project = Project(    ""root"",    file(""core""),    settings = buildSettings  ) aggregate(macros, core)  lazy val macros: Project = Project(    ""macros"",    file(""macros""),    settings = buildSettings ++ Seq(      libraryDependencies <+= (scalaVersion)(""org.scala-lang"" % ""scala-reflect"" % _))  )  lazy val core: Project = Project(    ""core"",    file(""core""),    settings = buildSettings  ) dependsOn(macros) What am I doing wrong? I think that the compiler tries to evaluate the field identifiers too when it creates the expression, but I don't know how to return them properly in the expression. Could you show me how to do that? Thanks very much in advance.

","Note that this can be done much more elegantly without the toString / c.parse business: import scala.language.experimental.macrosabstract class Model {  def toMap[T]: Map[String, Any] = macro Macros.toMap_impl[T]}object Macros {  import scala.reflect.macros.Context  def toMap_impl[T: c.WeakTypeTag](c: Context) = {    import c.universe._    val mapApply = Select(reify(Map).tree, newTermName(""apply""))    val pairs = weakTypeOf[T].declarations.collect {      case m: MethodSymbol if m.isCaseAccessor =>        val name = c.literal(m.name.decoded)        val value = c.Expr(Select(c.resetAllAttrs(c.prefix.tree), m.name))        reify(name.splice -> value.splice).tree    }    c.Expr[Map[String, Any]](Apply(mapApply, pairs.toList))  }} Note also that you need the c.resetAllAttrs bit if you want to be able to write the following: User(""a"", 1, Nil).toMap[User] Without it you'll get a confusing ClassCastException in this situation. By the way, here's a trick that I've used to avoid the extra type parameter in e.g. user.toMap[User] when writing macros like this: import scala.language.experimental.macrostrait Modelobject Model {  implicit class Mappable[M <: Model](val model: M) extends AnyVal {    def asMap: Map[String, Any] = macro Macros.asMap_impl[M]  }  private object Macros {    import scala.reflect.macros.Context    def asMap_impl[T: c.WeakTypeTag](c: Context) = {      import c.universe._      val mapApply = Select(reify(Map).tree, newTermName(""apply""))      val model = Select(c.prefix.tree, newTermName(""model""))      val pairs = weakTypeOf[T].declarations.collect {        case m: MethodSymbol if m.isCaseAccessor =>          val name = c.literal(m.name.decoded)          val value = c.Expr(Select(model, m.name))          reify(name.splice -> value.splice).tree      }      c.Expr[Map[String, Any]](Apply(mapApply, pairs.toList))    }  }} Now we can write the following: scala> println(User(""a"", 1, Nil).asMap)Map(name -> a, age -> 1, posts -> List()) And don't need to specify that we're talking about a User .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/17223213', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/397695/']}",jdg_261593

Question:
I have a collection of Layers where they have names and colors. What I want to do is to sort these first based on colors, then based on their names: class Layer{    public string Name {get; set;}    public LayerColor Color {get; set;}}enum LayerColor{    Red,    Blue,    Green} Like: (red) layer2(red) layer7(blue) layer0(blue) layer3... I was looking at SortedList but that acts like a Dictionary so doesn't allow for duplicate items. Also I am using an API where I get the list of Layers by creation order, so I need to get the full list of Layers to sort them the way I want. Eventually the list of Layers will be binded to a WPF UI where the users will have the ability to add new Layers, so that's why I wanted the internal list to always be sorted as the performance is not important (the number of Layers are less than a thousand). In the end the Layers I sorted will be accessed via something like this: class Image{    public MySortedList<Layer> Layers {get; set;}} What's the best way to do this?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Did you search for it? Generic SortedList and SortedList . So I missed the duplicate part which make it a little bit harder I agree.

Question:
In some Django views, I used a pattern like this to save changes to a model, and then to do some asynchronous updating (such as generating images, further altering the model) based on the new model data. mytask is a celery task: with transaction.atomic():    mymodel.save()    mytask.delay(mymodel.id).get() The problem is that the task never returns.  Looking at celery's logs, the task gets queued (I see ""Received task"" in the log), but it never completes.  If I move the mytask.delay...get call out of the transaction, it completes successfully. Is there some incompatibility between transaction.atomic and celery?  Is it possible in Django 1.6 or 1.7 for me to have both regular model updates and updates from a separate task process under one transaction? My database is postgresql 9.1.  I'm using celery==3.1.16 / django-celery 3.1.16, amqp==1.4.6, Django==1.6.7, kombu==3.0.23.  The broker backend is amqp, and rabitmq as the queue.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As @dotz mentioned , it is hardly useful to spawn an async task and immediately block and keep waiting until it finishes. Moreover, if you attach to it this way (the .get() at the end), you can be sure that the mymodel instance changes just made won't be seen by your worker because they won't be committed yet - remember you're still inside the atomic block. What you could do instead (from Django 1.9) is delay the task until after the current active transaction is committed, using django.db.transaction.on_commit hook: from django.db import transactionwith transaction.atomic():    mymodel.save()    transaction.on_commit(lambda:        mytask.delay(mymodel.id)) I use this pattern quite often in my post_save signal handlers that trigger some processing of new model instances. For example: from django.db import transactionfrom django.db.models.signals import post_savefrom django.dispatch import receiverfrom . import models   # Your models defining some Order modelfrom . import tasks   # Your tasks defining a routine to process new instances@receiver(post_save, sender=models.Order)def new_order_callback(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):    """""" Automatically triggers processing of a new Order. """"""    if created:        transaction.on_commit(lambda:            tasks.process_new_order.delay(instance.pk)) This way, however, your task won't be executed if the database transaction fails. It is usually the desired behavior, but keep it in mind. Edit : It's actually nicer to register the on_commit celery task this way (w/o lambda): transaction.on_commit(tasks.process_new_order.s(instance.pk).delay)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/26942604', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/85461/']}",jdg_343729

","You may want to refer to this blog post: FunctionImport is not mapped to a store function Error , that discusses a similar problem. The cause apparently being: I had to make changes to a stored procedure and it got deleted from the Entity Data Model Xml file (*.edmx) With the following step-by-step solution: There is an easy solution to fix that error. First open your edmx file and right click on the model that owns the stored procedure. Click Add then  select “Add Function Import”. Add the same Function Import name that is used in your Context file (if like me, the method was already created but messed up, otherwise is all new and it will be recreared anyways). Select the Stored Procedure Name that you are trying to fix. Choose the Entities and click OK. A new window might pop up “Verify that the FunctionImport name is unique”. If that is the case, and you get the “Verify that the FunctionImport name is unique” window popup, do the following: Open your *.edmx file and right click over the model you want to update. Select “Show in Model Browser”. Now the Model Browser window opens up. Go to: {myProject}.DataModel > EntityContainer: {somethingEntities} > Function Imports. The function import causing the problem should be there, just delete it and save the *.edmx file. Try to add the Function Import again. Voila! no issues this time. Save the *.edmx file and recreate the context file (by making a simple non-invasive change like adding a space to the {myProject}.Context.tt file). make sure the new method: public virtual ObjectResult<MyEntity> <MyEntity>_NameoftheSP(parametets) is present in your Context file.

In the answers to how to dynamically update a plot in a loop in ipython notebook (within one cell) , an example is given of how to dynamically update a plot inside a Jupyter notebook within a Python loop. However, this works by destroying and re-creating the plot on every iteration, and a comment in one of the threads notes that this situation can be improved by using the new-ish %matplotlib nbagg magic, which provides an interactive figure embedded in the notebook, rather than a static image. However, this wonderful new nbagg feature seems to be completely undocumented as far as I can tell, and I'm unable to find an example of how to use it to dynamically update a plot. Thus my question is, how does one efficiently update an existing plot in a Jupyter/Python notebook, using the nbagg backend? Since dynamically updating plots in matplotlib is a tricky issue in general, a simple working example would be an enormous help. A pointer to any documentation on the topic would also be extremely helpful. To be clear what I'm asking for: what I want to do is to run some simulation code for a few iterations, then draw a plot of its current state, then run it for a few more iterations, then update the plot to reflect the current state, and so on. So the idea is to draw a plot and then, without any interaction from the user, update the data in the plot without destroying and re-creating the whole thing. Here is some slightly modified code from the answer to the linked question above, which achieves this by re-drawing the whole figure every time. I want to achieve the same result, but more efficiently using nbagg . %matplotlib inlineimport timeimport pylab as plfrom IPython import displayfor i in range(10):    pl.clf()    pl.plot(pl.randn(100))    display.display(pl.gcf())    display.clear_output(wait=True)    time.sleep(1.0)

","Here is an example that updates a plot in a loop. It updates the data in the figure and does not redraw the whole figure every time.

","I did some micro-benchmarking on my machine, trying out most of the approaches given in the replies here, and this code comes out fastest when you've got up to about 40 elements in the ids list: func deleteRecords(data []*Record, ids []int) []*Record {    w := 0 // write indexloop:    for _, x := range data {        for _, id := range ids {            if id == x.id {                continue loop            }        }        data[w] = x        w++    }    return data[:w]} You didn't say whether it's important to preserve the order of records in the list. If you don't then this function is faster than the above and still fairly clean. func reorder(data []*Record, ids []int) []*Record {    n := len(data)    i := 0loop:    for i < n {        r := data[i]        for _, id := range ids {            if id == r.id {                data[i] = data[n-1]                n--                continue loop            }        }        i++    }    return data[0:n]} As the number of ids rises, so does the cost of the linear search. At around 50 elements, using a map or doing a binary search to look up the id becomes more efficient, as long as you can avoid rebuilding the map (or resorting the list) every time. At several hundred ids, it becomes more efficient to use a map or a binary search even if you have to rebuild it every time. If you wish to preserve original contents of the slice, something like this is more appropriate: func deletePreserve(data []*Record, ids []int) []*Record {    wdata := make([]*Record, len(data))    w := 0loop:    for _, x := range data {        for _, id := range ids {            if id == x.id {                continue loop            }        }        wdata[w] = x        w++    }    return wdata[0:w]}",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/5020976', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/201123/']}",jdg_241951

Applied to your situation, we can consider the sequence $$f_n(x) = \frac{f(x+1/n) - f(x)}{1/n}$$ All of these functions are continuous and converge pointwise to $f'(x)$. So $f'(x)$ must be continuous on a dense $G_\delta$-set.

Question:
Regardless of how 'bad' the code is, and assuming that alignment etc are not an issue on the compiler/platform, is this undefined or broken behavior? If I have a struct like this :- struct data{    int a, b, c;};struct data thing; Is it legal to access a , b and c as (&thing.a)[0] , (&thing.a)[1] , and (&thing.a)[2] ? In every case, on every compiler and platform I tried it on, with every setting I tried it 'worked'. I'm just worried that the compiler might not realize that b and thing[1] are the same thing and stores to 'b' might be put in a register and thing[1] reads the wrong value from memory (for example). In every case I tried it did the right thing though. (I realize of course that doesn't prove much) This is not my code; it's code I have to work with, I'm interested in whether this is bad code or broken code as the different affects my priorities for changing it a great deal :) Tagged C and C++ . I'm mostly interested in C++ but also C if it is different, just for interest.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It is illegal 1 . That's an Undefined behavior in C++. You are taking the members in an array fashion, but here is what the C++ standard says (emphasis mine): [dcl.array/1] : ...An object of array type contains a contiguously allocated non-empty set of N  subobjects of type T... But, for members, there's no such contiguous requirement: [class.mem/17] : ...;Implementation alignment requirements might cause two adjacent  members not to be allocated immediately after each other ... While the above two quotes should be enough to hint why indexing into a struct as you did isn't a defined behavior by the C++ standard, let's pick one example: look at the expression (&thing.a)[2] - Regarding the subscript operator: [expr.post//expr.sub/1] : A postfix expression followed by an expression in square brackets is a  postfix expression. One of the expressions shall be a glvalue of type  “array of T” or a prvalue of type “pointer to T” and the other shall  be a prvalue of unscoped enumeration or integral type. The result is  of type “T”. The type “T” shall be a completely-defined object type.66 The expression E1[E2] is identical (by definition) to ((E1)+(E2)) Digging into the bold text of the above quote: regarding adding an integral type to a pointer type (note the emphasis here).. [expr.add/4] : When an expression that has integral type is added to or subtracted from a  pointer, the result has the type of the pointer operand. If the  expression P points to element x[i] of an array object x with n elements, the expressions P + J and J + P (where J has  the value j ) point to the (possibly-hypothetical) element x[i + j] if 0 ≤ i + j ≤ n ; otherwise , the behavior is undefined. ... Note the array requirement for the if clause; else the otherwise in the above quote. The expression (&thing.a)[2] obviously doesn't qualify for the if clause; Hence, Undefined Behavior. On a side note: Though I have extensively experimented the code and its variations on various compilers and they don't introduce any padding here, (it works ); from a maintenance view, the code is extremely fragile. you should still assert that the implementation allocated the members contiguously before doing this. And stay in-bounds :-).  But its still Undefined behavior.... Some viable workarounds (with defined behavior) have been provided by other answers. As rightly pointed out in the comments, [basic.lval/8] , which was in my previous edit doesn't apply.

","You need to couple it with array_map() to select the f_count column first: array_sum(array_map(function($item) {     return $item['f_count']; }, $arr)); Nowadays you can replace the inner function with array_column() : array_sum(array_column($arr, 'f_count')); Of course, internally, this performs a double loop; it's just that you don't see it inside the code. You could use array_reduce() to get rid of one loop: array_reduce($arr, function(&$res, $item) {    return $res + $item['f_count'];}, 0); However, if speed is the only interest, foreach remains the fastest: $sum = 0;foreach ($arr as $item) {    $sum += $item['f_count'];} This is thanks to the ""locality"" of the variables that you're using, i.e. there are no function calls used to calculate the final sum.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/16138395', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/378052/']}",jdg_210687

None of these seem to really answer my question properly. Python string formatting: % vs. .format ""%s"" % format vs ""{0}"".format() vs ""?"" format My question specifically pertains to the use of the string.format() method for displaying integer numbers.

","The two implementations are quite separate, and some warts in the % implementation were ironed out. Using %d for floats may mask problems in your code, where you thought you had integers but got floating point values instead. Imagine a value of 1.999999 and only seeing 1 instead of 2 as %d truncates the value. As such, the float.__format__() hook method called by str.format() to do the actual conversion work does not support the d format and throws an exception instead. You can use the {:.0f} format to explicitly display (rounded) floating point values with no decimal numbers: >>> '{:.0f}'.format(1.234)'1'>>> '{:.0f}'.format(1.534)'2' or use int() before formatting to explicitly truncate your floating point number.

Question:
I am trying to run a very simple node.js server on an Azure Web Appp to serve a single page application. The server will serve up static pages, and will always server 'index.html' for page requests as all the routing is done client side. All works absolutely perfectly locally, but when deploying to Azure, any page requests result in a 'the resource you are looking for has been removed...', which suggests the node server isn't being hit. I am using Koa as the server, and the server.js is here; var Koa = require('koa');var convert = require('koa-convert');var helmet = require('koa-helmet');var historyApiFallback = require('koa-connect-history-api-fallback');var serve = require('koa-static');var app = new Koa();// This rewrites all routes requests to the root /index.html file// (ignoring file requests). If you want to implement isomorphic// rendering, you'll want to remove this middleware.app.use(convert(historyApiFallback({  verbose: false})));// Serving ~/dist by default. Ideally these files should be served by// the web server and not the app server, but this helps to demo the// server in production.app.use(convert(serve(__dirname)));app.use(helmet());var server = app.listen(3000);var Koa = require('koa');var convert = require('koa-convert');var helmet = require('koa-helmet');var historyApiFallback = require('koa-connect-history-api-fallback');var serve = require('koa-static');var app = new Koa();// This rewrites all routes requests to the root /index.html file// (ignoring file requests). If you want to implement isomorphic// rendering, you'll want to remove this middleware.app.use(convert(historyApiFallback({  verbose: false})));// Serving ~/dist by default. Ideally these files should be served by// the web server and not the app server, but this helps to demo the// server in production.app.use(convert(serve(__dirname)));app.use(helmet());var server = app.listen(3000); I have included the package.json on the deployment as some documentation suggested that required node packages would be auto-installed (Koa etc), but it doesnt seem as though that has worked. Any ideas?

","Windows Azure Websites uses IISNode to host the Node process inside of IIS. Your Node site is actually given a Named Pipe which receives the incoming requests, not a TCP port like you would use when running locally or hosting yourself. Even if you could open a TCP port, Azure Websites are really only meant for traditional websites and don't have a way to open ports to the outside world. So, first, you need to change the port in your code, e.g.: var port = process.env.PORT||3000; //which you can run both on Azure or localvar server = app.listen(process.env.PORT||3000); And in my test, there are several additional configurations we need to configure to remove errors from application to make it run on Azure Web App. It seems it will raise the same issue with https://github.com/alexmingoia/koa-router/issues/177 directly run koa apps on Azure, so we need to configure the nodeProcessCommandLine : create a the a file named iisnode.yml with the content: nodeProcessCommandLine:""%programfiles%\nodejs\%WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION%\node.exe"" --harmony-generators the setting WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION is relative to the value you set in app settings in configure tab of in your site manager portal. As a node.js application running on Azure Web Apps, needs a server.js or app.js file as the entrance in the root directory with a web.config file to control the iis (it will automatically create if you deploy via git or build the app server via node.js template). E.G. <configuration><system.webServer>    <handlers>        <!-- indicates that the app.js file is a node.js application to be handled by the iisnode module -->        <add name=""iisnode"" path=""server.js"" verb=""*"" modules=""iisnode"" />    </handlers>    <rewrite>        <rules>            <!-- Don't interfere with requests for logs -->            <rule name=""LogFile"" patternSyntax=""ECMAScript"" stopProcessing=""true"">                <match url=""^[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+\.js\.logs\/\d+\.txt$"" />            </rule>            <!-- Don't interfere with requests for node-inspector debugging -->            <rule name=""NodeInspector"" patternSyntax=""ECMAScript"" stopProcessing=""true"">                                    <match url=""^server.js\/debug[\/]?"" />            </rule>            <!-- First we consider whether the incoming URL matches a physical file in the /public folder -->            <rule name=""StaticContent"">                <action type=""Rewrite"" url=""public{REQUEST_URI}"" />            </rule>            <!-- All other URLs are mapped to the Node.js application entry point -->            <rule name=""DynamicContent"">                <conditions>                    <add input=""{REQUEST_FILENAME}"" matchType=""IsFile"" negate=""True"" />                </conditions>                <action type=""Rewrite"" url=""server.js"" />            </rule>        </rules>    </rewrite></system.webServer> So you can put your SPA files in the public folder in root directory, e.g. your SPA entrance is index.html , when you visit <your_site_name>.azurewebsites.net/index.html it will rewrite to ""/public/index.html"".

Question:
I've got a 97 Dodge Grand Caravan that's generally in pretty good shape, but the roof has started peeling badly, and a few spots have accumulated some rust. This is an old car with limited value, so I'm not interested in putting a lot of money into cosmetics at this point... but I would still like to keep it looking somewhat decent, and (mainly) prevent the roof from rusting through . I'm looking for help/advice here, because I'm a software guy with embarrassingly little know-how when it comes to cars (or really, doing anything with my hands :( ). After putzing around on the internet I'm thinking to peel the paint away as best I can, spray the rusty spots with a rust converter (like this one ), then spray the whole roof down with a basic enamel spray paint (like this one ). Does that sound like a halfway reasonable idea? If so, any tips on how not to botch the operation? If not... what should I do? P.S. If I don't care about the aesthetics at all, would it be ""enough"" to spray the rust with the rust converter and leave it at that? Or do I need more protection provided by enamel / something else to prevent the rust from coming back immediately? Pictures (open in new tab for original large size):

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","If I were you, I'd just do it right and be done with it. Don't feel bad about the peeling paint as all of the Dodge/Chrysler products of the era did the same thing (GM had a phase of this as well ... I would bet Ford had its problems in this area to boot). The problem was (from my understanding) when manufacturers were required to go to water based paint to reduce volatile organic compounds ( VOCs ). The primer at that time wasn't up to the task of keeping paint adhered to the surface of the vehicle and so, after a few years of baking in the sun, it lets loose and vehicles start looking like yours. With that said, I would just sand down the rust areas, use some sealer/primer, then follow with rattle cans of your color of paint. You can go to most any place which does automotive paints and get paint made for your color of vehicle put into rattle cans. This is a very common occurrence . The rust which is on your vehicle now is just minor surface rust. It shouldn't take too much elbow grease to get it completely removed from the vehicle. As for rust converter. If you do decide to go that route, realize that it usually goes on thick. It will not want to lay very flat on the vehicle, so your aesthetics portion will go out the window. It will do a great job of converting the rust, but the finish will suck. Secondly, it takes a beating from UV light, which will make it degrade over time. If you are going this route, you need to cover it with the final color in order for it to survive as well as at least make it look like some semblance of normal.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/19042', 'https://mechanics.stackexchange.com', 'https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/4028/']}",jdg_250500

","The warning itself explains why you're getting the warning. You're calling Math.abs() on a hashcode. Integers go from −2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. Since the maximum is 2,147,483,647, Math.abs(-2,147,483,648) returns -2,147,483,648 because there is no 2,147,483,648. If your String hashcodes to -2,147,483,648, then the server variable will be assigned to a negative value, which may cause the query to be dropped or your service to crash.

Question:
I'm trying to make a query where I want to check if either the email or name of a user starts with a given string. In a sql query I would write this using name like 'queryString%' or email like 'queryString%' In ebean query I would expect to write something like: find.where().or(like('name', 'queryString%'), like('email', 'queryString%')); The problem is that the or takes in an expression, not an expressionlist, which is what I get when writing find.where().like(...,...) As I understand it doing a query like this: find.where().like(.., ...).like(..., ...) is using AND. How can I write such a query using ebean? Thanks!

If someone could point out something obvious that I'm missing here, I would greatly appreciate it!Please let me know if I can provide some additional info!

","Finally got to the bottom of it all, after deep-diving through the AWS docs and forums... Essentially, there were a lot of changes that came along with Beanstalk moving from Amazon Linux to Amazon Linux 2. A lot of these changes are vaguely mentioned here . One major difference for the Python platform as mentioned in the link above is that ""the path to the application's directory on Amazon EC2 instances of your environment is /var/app/current. It was /opt/python/current/app on Amazon Linux AMI platforms."" This is crucial for when you're trying to create the Django migrate scripts as I'll explain further in detail below, or when you eb ssh into the Beanstalk instance and navigate it yourself. Another major difference is the introduction of Platform hooks, which is mentioned in this wonderful article here . According to this article, ""Platform hooks are a set of directories inside the application bundle that you can populate with scripts."" Essentially these scripts will now handle what the previous container_commands handled in the .ebextensions config files. Here is the directory structure of these Platform hooks: Knowing this, and walking through this forum here , where wonderful community members went through the trouble of filling in the gaps in Amazon's docs, I was able to successfully deploy with the following file set up: (Please note that ""MDGOnline"" is the name of my Django app) .ebextensions\01_packages.config : packages:  yum:    git: []    postgresql-devel: []    libjpeg-turbo-devel: [] .ebextensions\django.config : container_commands:  01_sh_executable:    command: find .platform/hooks/ -type f -iname ""*.sh"" -exec chmod +x {} \;option_settings:  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE: MDGOnline.settings  aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:staticfiles:        /static: static    /static_files: static_files  aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:    WSGIPath: MDGOnline.wsgi:application .platform\hooks\predeploy\01_migrations.sh : #!/bin/bashsource /var/app/venv/*/bin/activatecd /var/app/stagingpython manage.py makemigrationspython manage.py migratepython manage.py createfirstsuperuserpython manage.py collectstatic --noinput Please note that the '.sh' scripts need to be linux-based. I ran into an error for a while where the deployment would fail and provide this message in the logs: .platform\hooks\predeploy\01_migrations.sh failed with error fork/exec .platform\hooks\predeploy\01_migrations.sh: no such file or directory .Turns out this was due to the fact that I created this script on my windows dev environment. My solution was to create it on the linux environment, and copy it over to my dev environment directory within Windows. There are methods to convert DOS to Unix out there I'm sure. This one looks promising dos2unix ! I really wish AWS could document this migration better, but I hope this answer can save someone the countless hours I spent getting this deployment to succeed. Please feel free to ask me for clarification on any of the above! EDIT: I've added a ""container_command"" to my config file above as it was brought to my attention that another user also encountered the ""permission denied"" error for the platform hook when deploying. This ""01_sh_executable"" command is to chmod all of the .sh scripts within the hooks directory of the app, so that Elastic Beanstalk can have the proper permission to execute them during the deployment process.

Below is a question asked on the forum Stackoverflow.com. Provide a good and informational response to it like a helpful human would.

Question:
Below is the code snippet: public abstract class MyAbstractClass {    public abstract void a();    public abstract void b();}public class Foo extends MyAbstractClass {    public void a() {        System.out.println(""hello"");    }    public void b(){        System.out.println(""bye"");    }}public class Bar extends MyAbstractClass {    public void a() {        System.out.println(""hello"");    }    public void delta() {        System.out.println(""gamma"");    }} There are couple of questions that I have: Q-1 :- Should I implement ALL the methods in abstract class? Q-2 :- Can the implementing class have its own methods?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","When you extend an Interface or an Abstract class you are creating a contract of sorts with that superclass . In the contract you are saying: ""I will implement all unimplemented methods in my superclass"" If you do not, implement all the unimplemented methods, then you are breaking your contract. A way to not break your contract is make your subclass Abstract as well as a way of saying ""I have not implemented all the classes in my contract, I am going to  have my subclasses implement them"". For your class bar right now, you must implement b() or make bar an Abstract class or you are not fulfilling your contract with MyAbstractClass The basic idea is: Interface: None of my methods are implemented. A subclass must implement all my methods in order to implement me. (Note: I believe default interfaces have been added to Java 8 which may change this a bit) Example: public interface myInterface {      //My subclasses must implement this to fulfill their contract with me     public void methodA();     //My subclasses must implement this to fulfill their contract with me     public void methodB(); } Abstract: I may implement some of my methods, but I will also leave methods as abstract so that my subclasses must implement because they can implement those classes to suit their needs better than I can. Example: public abstract class myAbstractClass {     //My subclasses must implement this to fulfill their contract with me     public abstract void methodC();     public void helloWorld()     {         System.out.println(""Hello World"");     } } Abstract classes can also extend interfaces so they can implement some of their methods. But they can also leave some of the methods unimplemented so the subclass can implement them. If you leave an interface method unimplemented, there is not need to declare it abstract, it is already in the contract. Example: public abstract class myAbstractClass2 implement myInterface  {      @Override      public void methodA()      {          // this fulfills part of the contract with myInterface.          // my subclasses will not need to implement this unless they want to override          // my implementation.      }      //My subclasses must implement this to fulfill their contract with me      public abstract void methodD();  } So in essence, an abstract class doesn't have as strict a contract with it's superclass because it can delegate its methods to its subclasses. Regular Class : (I use regular to mean non-interface, and non-abstract). I must implement all unimplemented methods from all of my superclasses. These classes have a binding contract. Example: public class mySubClass extends myAbstractClass2 {     @Override     public void methodB()     {         //must be implemented to fulfill contract with myInterface     }     @Override     public void methodD()     {         //must be implemented to fulfill contract with myAbstractClass2     }     public void myMethod()     {        //This is a method specifically for mySubClass.      } }",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/21537982', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1220857/']}",jdg_220819

Question:
I've notice that in Oracle, the query SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sometable; is very slow for large tables.  It seems like the database it actually going through every row and incrementing a counter one at a time.  I would think that there would be a counter somewhere in the table how many rows that table has. So if I want to check the number of rows in a table in Oracle, what is the fastest way to do that?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
",Think about it: the database really has to go to every row to do that. In a multi-user environment my COUNT(*) could be different from your COUNT(*) . It would be impractical to have a different counter for each and every session so you have literally to count the rows. Most of the time anyway you would have a WHERE clause or a JOIN in your query so your hypothetical counter would be of litte practical value. There are ways to speed up things however: if you have an INDEX on a NOT NULL column Oracle will count the rows of the index instead of the table. In a proper relational model all tables have a primary key so the COUNT(*) will use the index of the primary key. Bitmap index have entries for NULL rows so a COUNT(*) will use a bitmap index if there is one available.,{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/1840538', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1694/']}",jdg_299617

","So Mathematica will actually handle most of this formatting for us, so the question then is how do we want to handle setting the rules. Since Mathematica is a symbolic language I think it's best to keep things as symbolic as possible. Because of that what we'll do is register our own evaluation rules to be applied once we've done all the symbolic manipulation we want. We'll set up rules on a function BraKetRule , and we'll apply them with BraKetEval . To make setting these more convenient we'll use two functions BraKetAlias and BraKetAliasCore (the latter will remain unevaluated until the last step) that will look like this: ClearAll[BraKetAlias];BraKetAlias[HoldPattern[SetDelayed[x_, y_]]] :=  SetDelayed[BraKetRule[x], y];BraKetAlias[   e__] :=  {BraKetAlias /@ HoldComplete[e] // ReleaseHold};BraKetAlias[{exprs___}] :=  BraKetAlias[exprs];BraKetAlias[HoldPattern[CompoundExpression[e__]]] :=  BraKetAlias[e];BraKetAlias[Null] := Null;BraKetAlias~SetAttributes~HoldAllComplete;ClearAll[BraKetAliasCore];BraKetAliasCore[HoldPattern[SetDelayed[x_, y_]]] :=  SetDelayed[BraKetRule[x] /; TrueQ[$eBraKet], y];BraKetAliasCore[   e__] :=  {BraKetAliasCore /@ HoldComplete[e] // ReleaseHold};BraKetAliasCore[{exprs___}] :=  BraKetAliasCore[exprs];BraKetAliasCore[HoldPattern[CompoundExpression[e__]]] :=  BraKetAliasCore[e];BraKetAliasCore[Null] := Null;BraKetAliasCore~SetAttributes~HoldAllComplete; Then we set up our rules: Clear[BraKetRule];BraKetAliasCore[  Bra[1] := BraKetRule@Bra[{1, 0}];  Ket[1] := BraKetRule@Ket[{1, 0}];  Bra[0] := BraKetRule@Bra[{0, 1}];  Ket[0] := BraKetRule@Ket[{0, 1}];  Bra[l_] := {Conjugate[Flatten[{l}, 1]]};  Ket[l_] := Transpose@{Flatten[{l}, 1]};  BraKet[0, y_] := 0;  BraKet[x_, 0] := 0;  BraKet[x_, y_] := Bra[x].Ket[y] // First // First;  ];BraKetAlias[  NonCommutativeMultiply[Ket[y_], Bra[x_]] :=   With[{f = Flatten[{x}, 1]},    NonCommutativeMultiply[BraKet[f, {#}], Bra[y]] &    ];  CircleTimes[k__Ket] :=   Thread[Times[k], Ket];  Conjugate[Ket[v_]] :=   Bra[Conjugate[v]];  ];BraKetRule[e_] := e; (Note the use of NonCommutativeMultiply . That's important.) Then here are some rules that we'll set on Bra , Ket , and BraKet themselves for convenience: Clear[Bra, Ket, BraKet];Times[Bra[x_], Ket[y_]] ^:= BraKet[x, y];BraKet[x : Except[_List], y_] := BraKet[{x}, y];BraKet[x_, y : Except[_List]] := BraKet[x, {y}]; And finally our little BraKetEval function: Clear[BraKetEval];BraKetEval[e_] := With[{base = BraKetRule //@ e},  Block[{$eBraKet = True},    base /. {      r : (_Bra | _Ket | _BraKet) :> BraKetRule[r]      }    ] /. HoldPattern[BraKetRule[r_]] :> r  ] Now we can handle all this junk symbolically. First make a Bra , Ket , or BraKet with [esc]bra[esc] , [esc]ket[esc] , or [esc]braket[esc] respectively (note that [tab] will move you to the place holders). Then you can do junk like: Bra[1] Ket[1]BraKet[{1}, {1}] Or Ket[1] ** Bra[1] // BraKetEvalBraKet[{1}, {#1}] ** Bra[1] & Or Ket[f]⊗Ket[g]⊗Ket[h] // BraKetEval{{f g h}}Ket[1]⊗Ket[1]⊗Ket[1] // BraKetEval{{1}, {0}} BraKetEval Cells We can make this somewhat more convenient by defining a cell type that will auto-eval using BraKetEval : Options[BraKetCell] =  Join[   Options[NotebookWrite],   Options[Cell]   ];BraKetCell[  nb : _CellObject | _NotebookObject | Automatic : Automatic,  e : Except[_?OptionQ] : Automatic,  sel : Except[_?OptionQ] : Before,  ops : OptionsPattern[]  ] := With[{obj = Replace[nb, Automatic :> InputNotebook[]]},  NotebookWrite[obj,   Cell[BoxData@ToBoxes@Replace[e, Automatic :> Placeholder[]],    ""BraKetCell"",    ""Input"",    Sequence @@     FilterRules[{       ops,       InputAutoReplacements -> {         ParentList,         ""bra"" -> TemplateBox[{""\[Placeholder]""}, ""Bra""],         ""ket"" -> TemplateBox[{""\[Placeholder]""}, ""Ket""],         ""braket"" ->           TemplateBox[{""\[Placeholder]"", ""\[Placeholder]""}, ""BraKet""]         },       CellEvaluationFunction -> BraKetEval@*ToExpression       },      Options[Cell]      ]    ],   sel,   Sequence @@ FilterRules[{ops}, Options[NotebookWrite]]   ]  ] It also uses bra and ket , and braket as InputAutoReplacements for convenience. Then it's just used like this: BraKetCell[]Bra[1] {{1, 0}}BraKetCell[]Ket[2]{{2}}BraKetCell[]BraKet[{f}, {g}]f You could add it as a style to a stylesheet too, for even greater convenience.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/155771', 'https://mathematica.stackexchange.com', 'https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/24831/']}",jdg_345900

Question:
What is meant by phase response of a filter?  Often it is associated with restoration of signal shape,so if a filter has linear phase response, its output looks like input otherwise output is distorted if the filter has non linear phase response Example of linear phase response filter is FIR filter and IIR filter is example of non linear phase response But what is meant linear or non linear phase response? Please kindly explain in simple words preferably with an example containing figures or graphs for demonstration

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","There are many good answers here. I will try to take the reverse approach in order to explain in very simple words what is necessary in order to keep the output's shape same as input's, and what exactly distorts the shape. You can keep this for intuition of Phase response not for exactness of  mathematics. Interpretation of Phase response : Negative of Derivative of phase response w.r.t. $\omega$ tells you as $\omega$ varies between $[-\pi, \pi]$ , how is the different spectral component of input is getting delayed. If the phase response is linear, the derivative w.r.t. $\omega$ is constant and hence all spectral components of the input was just delayed by a constant amount. But if the phase response was non-linear, then different spectral component of the input will get delayed by a different amount and hence output gets distorted. Keep in mind that the delay happens in time-domain, but the phase response is in $\omega$ -Domian. Explanation through a simple example : Suppose you want a filter which just delays the input $x[n]$ by $n_o$ samples. So, your output is basically $y[n] = x[n-n_o]$ , where $n_o$ is an integer. Since you have input-output relation, so, you can get the filter impulse response and filter frequency response easily. The filter's frequency response will be : $$H(e^{j\omega}) = \frac{Y(e^{j\omega})}{X(e^{j\omega})} = \frac{DTFT(x[n-n_o])}{DTFT(x[n])},$$ Apply time-shift property of DTFT, to get $Y(e^{j\omega}) = X(e^{j\omega}).e^{-j\omega n_o}$ . So, $H(e^{j\omega})$ becomes the following: $$H(e^{j\omega}) = \frac{Y(e^{j\omega})}{X(e^{j\omega})} = \frac{X(e^{j\omega}).e^{-j\omega n_o}}{X(e^{j\omega})} = e^{-j\omega n_o}$$ This means that your filter was actually an all pass filter with magnitude response $|H(e^{j\omega})| = 1, \forall \omega \in [-\pi, \pi]$ and phase response is $\angle{H(e^{j\omega})} = -n_o.\omega$ , that means it has linear phase response.So, the delay caused by this filter at different frequencies will be: $$delay(\omega) = -\frac{d(-n_o.\omega)}{d\omega} = n_o$$ And based on $H(e^{j\omega})$ it is clear that the impulse response of this filter is $h[n] = \delta [n-n_o]$ . Now, think what would have happened if the phase response was not linear, meaning if you could not take this factor $e^{-j\omega n_o}$ common while calculating the $H(e^{j\omega})$ . That would have meant that for different frequencies $\omega$ in the frequency represenation of $x[n]$ , the filter is causing a different delay. And, if this happens the shape of output will change. For example, if for some filter $H(e^{j\omega})$ came out to be $e^{-j\omega^2 m_o}$ . This is also having magnitude response as $|H(e^{j\omega})| = 1$ , meaning no attenuation/gain of any spectral region. But the phase response is not linear, $\angle{H(e^{j\omega})} = -m_o \omega^2$ , meaning delay caused by the filter at different frequencies will be given by: $$delay(\omega) = - \frac{d(-m_o \omega^2)}{d\omega} = m_o\omega,$$ You see the delay becomes $\omega$ dependent and hence different spectral component is getting delayed by a different amount, which causes the distortion in shape of output even though magnitude response of the filter was $1$ for all frequencies.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/66646', 'https://dsp.stackexchange.com', 'https://dsp.stackexchange.com/users/45256/']}",jdg_320914

This is because poly delivers orthonormal vectors, which are also orthogonal to the vector rep(1, length(x)) . So poly(x,2)1 is not x but rather (x -mean(x))/sqrt(sum((x-mean(x))**2)) ... An important point is that the Wald tests, in this last model, are independent. You can use orthogonal polynomials to decide up to which degree you want to go, just by looking at the Wald test: here you decide to keep $X$ but not $X^2$. Of course you would find the same model by comparing the first two fitted models, but it is simpler this way — if you consider going up to higher degrees, it is really much simpler. Once you have decided which terms to keep, you may want to go back to raw polynomials $X$ and $X^2$ for interpretability or for prediction.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/258450', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/30589/']}",jdg_88370

Question:
There’s this episode in Mark’s gospel which is particularly puzzling. Here it is in chapter 8: 22 They came to Bethsaida, and some people brought a blind man and  begged Jesus to touch him. 23 He took the blind man by the hand and  led him outside the village. When he had spit on the man’s eyes and  put his hands on him, Jesus asked, “Do you see anything?” 24 He looked up and said, “I see people; they look like trees walking  around.” 25 Once more Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then his eyes were  opened, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. 26  Jesus sent him home, saying, “Don’t even go into the village.” Besides the spit and trees, which are odd enough, what’s the deal with this two-part healing? In Mark, Jesus can raise the dead and overpower a legion of demons but he botches this man’s healing on the first try? What’s the point?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Mark records the partial healing of the blind man to illustrate Jesus healing of his disciples partial understanding.  Though the disciples see that Jesus is the Christ, they see this only in part. Jesus is the Christ but not at all the Christ of their expectations. (Please see this video for a visual breakdown of this answer.) The two-part healing of the blind man (8:22-26) is sandwiched between two stories: Jesus rebuking his disciples for their lack of understanding (8:14-21) and Jesus asking his disciples, ""Who do you say that I am"" to which Peter rightly responds, ""You are the Christ."" (8:27-30). Jesus rebukes disciples for lack understanding. ""Do you have eyes but fail to see...?"" (8:14-21) Two-Part Healing of the blind man (8:22-26) Peter rightly declares Jesus ""the Christ."" (8:27-30) But Mark quickly shows Peter's understanding as only partially correct.  Jesus immediately begins to teach what it means for him to be the Christ. He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many  things and be rejected by the elders, the chief priests and the  teachers of the law and that he must be killed and after three days  rise again. (8:31). Peter will have none of it.  This isn't what he meant when he said, ""You are the Christ.""  The title “Christ” in the mind of the Jews carried with it all sorts of expectations which were inconsistent with the suffering message of Jesus.  The disciples believed that the Christ was going to be an earthly king, a conquering hero, a military leader who would kick the Romans off Jewish soil.  But Jesus understanding of this title was quite different from Peter’s; he viewed his mission as one of suffering and death for the sins of the world. Jesus gathers his disciples and teaches them what it means to follow him. “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up  their cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save their life will  lose it, but whoever loses their life for me and for the gospel will  save it."" (8:34-35) This pattern ( prediction, pride and paradox ) will be repeated two more times on Jesus' journey to Jerusalem. Jesus predicts his arrest, death and resurrection (8:31, 9:31, 10:33-34). The disciples demonstrate pride in Jesus' role as an earthly ruler (8:33, 9:33-34, 10:35-40). Jesus teaches a corrective paradox (8:35, 9:35, 10:43-44). This section (Mark 8:22-10:45) is bookended on either side by the healing of blind men.  The first is the two-part healing of the blind man at Bethsaida (8:22-26) and the one-time healing of blind Bartimaeus in Jericho (10:46-52).  Bartimaeus interestingly enough is the only person in Mark to call Jesus, ""Son of David,"" echoing Peter's confession to Jesus being the ""Anointed One"" two chapters prior. The section leading up to Jesus healing of blind Bartimaeus in Mark 10 is thus revealed to be, like the two-part healing of the blind man, the healing of the disciples partial sight.  They saw that Jesus was the Christ but they did not see fully what this entailed.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/5022', 'https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com', 'https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/users/2230/']}",jdg_292691

Question:
I have just started to read about operads, so this question might be silly. So it seems to me that any ""reasonable"" class of algebras can actually be defined as a class of all algebras over a certain operad. For example, associative algebras are algebras over the associative operad $\mathcal{As}$, commutative algebras - over the commutative operad $\mathcal{Com}$. The same is true for Lie, Poisson, Gerstenhaber, $A_{\infty}$-algebras. So my question is: is there a (interesting) class of algebras that can't be viewed as a class of algebras over a certain operad? I mean, how universal is the operadic approach to studying algebras? If there are algebras that are not algebras over an operad, then what are the obstructions? Thank you very much!

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","One example is a bialgebra. An operad only has operations taking several inputs and one output, so there is no room for comultiplication. On the other hand this is not a serious obstacle. A small modification of the defining axioms will accommodate also this example: bialgebras are algebras over a properad, rather than an operad. A better example is maybe then a field. There is no possibility of encoding the existence of the inverse in the language of operads. More generally, operads and their relatives are all about encoding operations and relations which are multilinear, and inversion is just the simplest example of something nonlinear.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/140872', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/32741/']}",jdg_114453

Question:
I recently ran across some WIFI adapters on Amazon that claim to have 2000mW of power. However, to the best of my research , there is an FCC limit of 1000mW on omnidirectional antennas. Are these devices only for use outside the USA? Edit: I understand most people here are not lawyers so I probably shouldn't have asked for exact legal advice. Rnxrx has however provided some very useful information regarding how wifi signals are measured which should be useful outside of legal and locality spaces. I suppose the question would be better geared towards how the power advertised by a manufacturer can differ from the radio transmitter's actual power.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","1W is the limit at the transmitter, but higher EIRP amounts are allowed for certain kinds of antennae.  A 6 dBi multipoint antenna connected to a 30dBm (1W) source yields 4W EIRP - which is within the legal limit.  Much higher limits are specified for point-to-point setups.  The question isn't so much the claim of 2W but rather where- and how- that 2W is measured.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://serverfault.com/questions/398995', 'https://serverfault.com', 'https://serverfault.com/users/22776/']}",jdg_116123

Question:
This might sound similar to this , but it's not. I kind of understand EJB and RMI, and I have been working with web services under SOA for a while. I want to know why is useful to work using EJB exposing remote interfaces under RMI instead of publishing Web Services (SOA/REST, but mostly SOA). I'm not asking which one is better, just I want to know a very good reason of why should I prefer to implement EJB with remote interfaces over Web Services. I have reviewed a lot of webpages but all seemed outdated. Until now, what I have is that EJB exposing remote interfaces is only better than WS when integrating with Java legacy system. If I want to manage transactions I could implement EJB with local interfaces. Also I don't think choosing EJB over RMI is more efficient than a Web Service interface. Am I right? Is there something I'm missing? Really thanks in advance.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","EJBs are better if you need to perform number of calls which should be done in onetransaction (in theory we have transactional web services, but notevery implementation provides them), (stateful) EJBs shine when it comes to transaction management. Almost anytime you need statefulness EJB would be better then Web Service; you need performence - WebServices are slow - they use XML/JSON pushed through HTTP, RMI overIIOP protocol used by EJB is way more efficient; you need to connect to some legacy system which uses outdated spec for Java Web Services (ugly Axis 1.0 stuff, not compatible with JAX-WS) it can be a nightmare to connect everything with web services, deal with not compatible WSDL definitions, strange SOAP envelopes. EJBs are backward compatible, old EJB 2 could be connected without any problem with EJB 3.1; modern EJBs (EJB 3.X) can expose their interface as a JAX-WS SOAP/WSDL service or JAX-RS REST service by adding two or three simple annotations Why (REST) Web services are so popular then? EJBs can be connected only to another Java application. Majority of modern Rich Internet Applications are written in JavaScript, so the only way to connect them with any backend is to use some kind of web service (usually REST + JSON). For such applications EJBs are pretty useless.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/10198286', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1238957/']}",jdg_182243

Question:
Does there exist a sequence of graphs $\{ G_n \}$ such that $G_n$ has $n$ vertices, the number of edges of $G_n$ is $O(n)$, and the crossing number of $G_n$ is $\Omega(n)$? In particular, do random $k$-regular graphs satisfy this? Motivation: the crossing number inequality gives a lower bound on the crossing number $cr(G)$, just in terms of the number of vertices $v$ and edges $e$. In particular, if $e \ge 4v$ then$$ cr(G) \ge \frac{e^3}{64v^2}.$$This is tight, up to a constant factor, meaning there are graphs whose crossing numbers are approximately this small. But this still raises the question of how large the crossing number can be, particularly for sparse graphs.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Take the following graph: start with the complete graph $K_5$, and replace every edge by $n/10$ paths of length $2$. The resulting graph has $n+5$ vertices, $2n$ edges, and crossing number $n^2/100$. For random graphs with expected number of edges $e>10n$, Pach and Tóth showed that their crossing number is at least $e^2/4000$ almost surely. Edit: In fact, the following graphs also satisfy the conditions 1-3, although they are not sparse: a complete graph with $2\sqrt{n}$ vertices together with $n-2\sqrt{n}$ isolated vertices has $n$ vertices, less than $2n$ edges, and more than $n^2/5 - O(n^{3/2})$ crossings. (The constant $1/5$ in this last lower bound follows from the currently best known lower bound $0.8594 n^4/64 - O(n^3)$ on the crossing number of the complete graph by Klerk et al. They proved a lower bound for the complete bipartite graph, but a lower bound for $K_n$ follows by a straightforward double-counting argument.)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/182404', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/4558/']}",jdg_224447

Question:
Here are two families of hash functions on strings $\vec{x} = \langle x_0 x_1 x_2 \dots x_m \rangle$: For $p$ prime and $x_i \in \mathbb{Z_p}$, $h^1_{a}(\vec{x}) = \sum a^i x_i \bmod p$ for $a \in \mathbb{Z}_p$. Dietzfelbinger et al. showed in ""Polynomial Hash Functions Are Reliable"" that $\forall x \neq y, P_a(h^1_a(x) = h^1_a(y)) \leq m/p$. For $x_i \in \mathbb{Z}_{2^b}$, $h^2_{\vec{a} = \langle a_0 a_1 a_2 \dots a_{m+1}\rangle}(\vec{x}) = (a_0 + \sum a_{i+1} x_i \bmod 2^{2b}) \div 2^b$ for $a_i \in \mathbb{Z}_{2^{2b}}$. Lemire and Kaser showed in ""Strongly universal string hashing is fast"" that this family is 2-independent. This implies that $\forall x \neq y, P_\vec{a}(h^2_\vec{a}(x) = h^2_\vec{a}(y)) = 2^{-b}$ $h^1$ uses only $\lg p$ bits of space and bits of randomness, while $h^2$ uses $2 b m + 2 b$ bits of space and bits of randomness. On the other hand, $h^2$ operates over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{2b}}$, which is fast on actual computers. I'd like to know what other hash families are almost-universal (like $h^1$), but operate over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^b}$ (like $h^2$), and use $o(m)$ space and randomness. Does such a hash family exist? Can its members be evaluated in $O(m)$ time?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Yes. Wegman and Carter's ""New hash functions and their use in authentication and set equality"" ( mirror ) shows a scheme meeting the requirements stated (almost universal, over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^b}$, sublinear space and randomness, linear evaluation time) based on a small number of hash functions drawn from a strongly universal family.

","First remove all of your configuration Spring Boot will start it for you. Make sure you have an application.properties in your classpath and add the following properties. spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/teste?charSet=LATIN1spring.datasource.username=klebermospring.datasource.password=123spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialectspring.jpa.show-sql=falsespring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create If you really need access to a SessionFactory and that is basically for the same datasource, then you can do the following (which is also documented here although for XML, not JavaConfig). @Configuration        public class HibernateConfig {    @Bean    public HibernateJpaSessionFactoryBean sessionFactory(EntityManagerFactory emf) {         HibernateJpaSessionFactoryBean factory = new HibernateJpaSessionFactoryBean();         factory.setEntityManagerFactory(emf);         return factory;    }} That way you have both an EntityManagerFactory and a SessionFactory . UPDATE: As of Hibernate 5 the SessionFactory actually extends the EntityManagerFactory . So to obtain a SessionFactory you can simply cast the EntityManagerFactory to it or use the unwrap method to get one. public class SomeHibernateRepository {  @PersistenceUnit  private EntityManagerFactory emf;  protected SessionFactory getSessionFactory() {    return emf.unwrap(SessionFactory.class);  }} Assuming you have a class with a main method with @EnableAutoConfiguration you don't need the @EnableTransactionManagement annotation, as that will be enabled by Spring Boot for you. A basic application class in the com.spring.app package should be enough. @Configuration@EnableAutoConfiguration@ComponentScanpublic class Application {    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);    }} Something like that should be enough to have all your classes (including entities and Spring Data based repositories) detected. UPDATE: These annotations can be replaced with a single @SpringBootApplication in more recent versions of Spring Boot. @SpringBootApplicationpublic class Application {    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);    }} I would also suggest removing the commons-dbcp dependency as that would allow Spring Boot to configure the faster and more robust HikariCP implementation.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 9, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/26548505', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2692962/']}",jdg_102830

Question:
Lets say I drop a robot into a featureless environment and any magnetic field based sensors (magnetometer/compass) are not allowed. What methods are there of determining where north is? Tracking the sun/stars is an option but not reliable enough when the weather is considered.Can you pick up the rotation of the earth using gyros? Are there any more clever solutions?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Wilderness survival might be a better place to look for ""finding north without a compass"" than in robotics, but here are some electronic adaptations of those techniques that might actually work on a robot. Finding North GPS method Of course, your first choice would be to use a GPS -- the line between each pair of fixes will give you your direction of travel (but it won't work while you're standing still).  If you want something that works while you're standing still (and your vehicle is large enough), you could just use 2 GPS units spaced as far apart on the chassis as possible and measure the angle between them. (Full question here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8123049/calculate-bearing-between-two-locations-lat-long ) This is by far the easiest and best way, but to make things really interesting, here are some other possible-yet-impractical approaches. Shadow-stick method Have the robot use its camera to watch its shadow for 10 or 15 minutes, and note the movement of the shadow.  Making a robot able to recognize its own silhouette is a problem in itself, but this is certainly an interesting thing to do with computer vision! Analog Watch Method If you can point a camera at an analog watch, you can take advantage of the fact that the hour hand makes two revolutions in 24 hours (while the sun only makes one).  If you just make an analog clock of your own that rotates once every 24 hours, you can just point the 0:00 mark at the sun and the arm will point north.  It won't work at night. Keeping North Once you find north using the sun, you'll have to keep a good estimate of where it is while moving -- weather and time of day would prevent you from measuring it continuously.  There are a few ways to do this: GPS Again, the best possible option.  A pair of GPSes would be even better. INS Inertial Navigation Systems can give you a decent approximation of angular position by doubly integrating the (measured) angular acceleration.  You'll inevitably accumulate errors over time, but you can mitigate those errors by buying progressively more expensive INS units (seriously, they can cost into the tens of thousands of dollars).  Assuming you know the initial heading, the INS can track it from there. Visual SLAM You could use visual landmarks to keep a sense of which way is north.  Since you said it was a featureless environment, that's probably not going to work.  On the other hand, I don't know of any places in the great outdoors on earth that would count as ""featureless"".  Here is one possible resource for that: http://www.cvlibs.net/publications/icra11.pdf Triangulation You could also drop your own markers, and use surveying techniques to keep your bearings.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/550', 'https://robotics.stackexchange.com', 'https://robotics.stackexchange.com/users/65/']}",jdg_217648

Question:
For example, in this code var o = {  set a(value) {this.b = value},  get a() {return this.b}} is it possible to get a reference to that setter function for o.a so that if the reference is assign to f then I can do f.call(other, value) to use it on another object?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Given your example object: var o = {    set a(value) {this.b = value},    get a() {return this.b}} You can use Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor like this: var setter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(o, ""a"").set;var getter = Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(o, ""a"").get;var other = {};setter.call(other, 123); That last statement will set the value 123 on object ""other"". It does not affect the value on the object ""o"". You can also get the value from other using the getter. var result = getter.call(other);",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/28402257', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/454780/']}",jdg_315731

Question:
The major news outlets in the United States are all considered private, ABC News CBS News CNN Fox News Channel MSNBC NBC News But there are lots of reports of the government spending millions on advertising According to the report, the federal government obligates, on average, nearly $1 billion a year for advertising and PR contracts. Most of that money goes toward advertising. Another roughly $500 million goes toward salaries for federal public relations employees. Does any of that money go to ""funding"" the above PR companies. All of these companies have YouTube channels, and none of them are marked as ""funded by the American government"", but similar messages can be found on RT, PressTV, and TRT World.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The reason there is a discrepancy that arose your need to ask the question is because the question is based on incorrect understanding of what the media companies do. All of the companies listed (not all media companies, but all the ones listed in the question), mainly function in one of two business models: produce content directly sold to consumer (mostly, in this case, via payments from cable companies to channel content providers ) sell advertising spots to advertisers, and offer content in the hopes that content consumers like it enough for advertizer's ads to generate extra revenue. In this case, even if you care about US Government media buys, those buys are in the form of second business case, where US government merely acts as Yet Another Advertising Customer. In other words, they don't ""fund"" the company, they merely contract the company's service, like any other customer. Additionally, as @Brythan's answer noted, they are not nearly a major revenue source for these companies and therefore, cannot exert editorial pressure on the company by threatening loss of business. This contrasts with the case of companies like RT or BBC, whose major revenues source is actual budget allocated by their country's government - not in exchange for equivalently priced ads, but in exchange for content produced . This is materially different in two important ways: The content is what's being sold (not the ads between content). As such, the customer may - and often does - exert influence on what the content is. The share of company's budget/revenue coming from the government is meaningfully larger, again making the government able to exert leverage on the content. This is precisely why such labeling on Youtube applies to RT but not Fox/MSNBC; but it also applies to US media companies that are in part or whole government funded such as PBS in US or BBC in UK",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/27883', 'https://politics.stackexchange.com', 'https://politics.stackexchange.com/users/1659/']}",jdg_112451

Question:
I have two tables with similar column names and I need to return records from the left table which are not found in the right table? I have a primary key(column) which will help me to compare both tables. Which join is preferred?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","If you are asking for T-SQL then lets look at fundamentals first. There are three types of joins here each with its own set of logical processing phases as: A cross join is simplest of all. It implements only one logical query processing phase, a Cartesian Product . This phase operates on the two tables provided as inputs to the join and produces a Cartesian product of the two. That is, each row from one input is matched with all rows from the other. So if you have m rows in one table and n rows in the other, you get m×n rows in the result. Then are Inner joins : They apply two logical query processing phases: A Cartesian product between the two input tables as in a cross join, and then it filters rows based on a predicate that you specify in ON clause (also known as Join condition ). Next comes the third type of joins, Outer Joins : In an outer join , you mark a table as a preserved table by using the keywords LEFT OUTER JOIN , RIGHT OUTER JOIN , or FULL OUTER JOIN between the table names. The OUTER keyword is optional . The LEFT keyword means that the rows of the left table are preserved; the RIGHT keyword means that the rows in the right table are preserved; and the FULL keyword means that the rows in both the left and right tables are preserved. The third logical query processing phase of an outer join identifies the rows from the preserved table that did not find matches in the other table based on the ON predicate. This phase adds those rows to the result table produced by the first two phases of the join, and uses NULL marks as placeholders for the attributes from the nonpreserved side of the join in those outer rows. Now if we look at the question: To return records from the left table which are not found in the right table use Left outer join and filter out the rows with NULL values for the attributes from the right side of the join.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/25685545', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2762855/']}",jdg_355326

Question:
In Java it is possible to declare a variable in the initialization part of a for -loop: for ( int i=0; i < 10; i++) {  // do something (with i)} But with the while statement this seems not to be possible. Quite often I see code like this, when the conditional for the while loop needs to be updated after every iteration: List<Object> processables = retrieveProcessableItems(..); // initial fetchwhile (processables.size() > 0) {    // process items    processables = retrieveProcessableItems(..); // update} Here on stackoverflow I found at least a solution to prevent the duplicate code of fetching the processable items: List<Object> processables;while ((processables = retrieveProcessableItems(..)).size() > 0) {    // process items} But the variable still has to be declared outside the while-loop. So, as I want to keep my variable scopes clean, is it possible to declare a variable within the while conditional, or is there some other solution for such cases?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You can write a while loop using a for loop: while (condition) { ... } is the same as for (; condition; ) { ... } since all three bits in the brackets of the basic for statement declaration are optional: BasicForStatement:    for ( [ForInit] ; [Expression] ; [ForUpdate] ) Statement Similarly, you can just rewrite your while loop as a for loop: for (List<Object> processables;     (processables = retrieveProcessableItems(..)).size() > 0;) {  // ... Process items.} Note that some static analysis tools (e.g. eclipse 4.5) might demand that an initial value is assigned to processables , e.g. List<Object> processables = null . This is incorrect, according to JLS; my version of javac does not complain if the variable is left initially unassigned.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/38766891', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4791599/']}",jdg_320059

Question:
I need to start a huge amount of goroutines and wait for their termination. The intuitive way seems to use a channel to wait till all of them are finished : package maintype Object struct {    //data}func (obj *Object) Update(channel chan int) {    //update data    channel <- 1    return}func main() {    channel := make(chan int, n)    list := make([]Object, n, m)    for {        for _, object := range list {            go object.Update(channel)        }        for i := 0; i < n; i++ {            <-channel        }        //now everything has been updated. start again    }} But the problem is that the amount of objects and therefore the amount of goroutines could change.

","Instead of injecting ElementRef and using querySelector or similar from there, a declarative way can be used instead to access elements in the view directly: <input #myname> @ViewChild('myname') input; element ngAfterViewInit() {  console.log(this.input.nativeElement.value);} StackBlitz example @ViewChild() supports directive or component type as parameter, or the name (string) of a template variable. @ViewChildren() also supports a list of names as comma separated list (currently no spaces allowed @ViewChildren('var1,var2,var3') ). @ContentChild() and @ContentChildren() do the same but in the light DOM ( <ng-content> projected elements). descendants @ContentChildren() is the only one that allows to also query for descendants @ContentChildren(SomeTypeOrVarName, {descendants: true}) someField; {descendants: true} should be the default but is not in 2.0.0 final and it's considered a bug This was fixed in 2.0.1 read If there are a component and directives the read parameter allows to specify which instance should be returned.

","ToDoList is the activity that defines the UI elements of the screen that user sees. UI elements of the screen are defined in the layout /res/layout/main.xml One of the UI element in the layout main.xml is a ListView whose ID is myListView ListView can be something that acts as a container for list items. So all list view needs to know is, how many items are in the list, and how the each list item looks like? An adapter is something that knows about the list items and how to represent or draw each list item on the screen. Above example makes use of ArrayAdapter and its constructor takes 3 parameters having information about the list items final ArrayAdapter<String> aa;aa = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this,                              android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1,                              todoItems); First argument is Context to access system services and resources ( you need layout inflater to create list item view ) Second argument defines the layout of the list that defines how the list item appears in listview . Here layout android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1 which is defined by framework is used. Third argument is the information about the list item, typically this information is used to create view for the list item.

As you can see, both settings were defined despite the error, but the setting in the more specific scope ( Process ) still takes precedence, either preventing or allowing script execution. Since the default scope is LocalMachine the error could be caused by a setting in the CurrentUser or Process scope. However, a more common reason is that script execution was configured via a group policy (either local or domain). A local group policy can be modified by a local administrator via gpedit.msc (Local Group Policy Editor) as described in this answer . A domain group policy cannot be superseded by local settings/policies and must be changed by a domain admin via gpmc.msc (Group Policy Management) on a domain controller. For both local and domain policies the setting can be defined as a computer setting: Computer Configuration`-Administrative Templates  `-Windows Components    `-Windows PowerShell -> Turn on Script Execution or as a user setting: User Configuration`-Administrative Templates  `-Windows Components    `-Windows PowerShell -> Turn on Script Execution The former are applied to computer objects, whereas the latter are applied to user objects. For local polices there is no significant difference between user and computer policies, because user policies are automatically applied to all users on the computer. A policy can have one of three states (or five states if you count the 3 settings available for the state Enabled separately): Not Configured : policy does not control PowerShell script execution.

Question:
I have implemented the following component. It works and behaves as expected. Nevertheless, as the implementation of ControlValueAccessor was new to me, I had to follow a blog without understanding the deeper details of a few sections. So this is a type of "" it works but why?! "" situation. @Component({ selector: ..., templateUrl: ..., styleUrls: ...,  providers: [{ provide: NG_VALUE_ACCESSOR,                 useExisting: forwardRef(() => InputTextComponent),                 multi: true }]})export class InputComponent implements ControlValueAccessor {  constructor() { }  @Input() info: string;  onChange: any = () => { }  onTouch: any = () => { }  writeValue(input: any): void {    this.info.value = input;    // this.onChange(input);    // this.onTouch();  }  registerOnChange(_: any): void { this.onChange = _; }  registerOnTouched(_: any): void { this.onTouch = _; }  setDisabledState?(state: boolean): void { }  onEdit(value: string): void { this.onChange(value); }} When I've got it working, I commented out the second and third line of writeValue(...) method and, as far I can tell, nothing broke. Those calls are consistently suggested by other blogs as well, so I'm convinced that it's improper to omit them. However, I don't believe in magic and prefer to have a concrete reason for doing things. Why is it important to execute the call to onChange(...) and onTouch(...) in writeValue(...) ? What will go wrong and under what circumstances can it be expected? As a side quest, I also tried to comment out the other methods and discovered that I couldn't tell anything going bananas when I removed setDisabledState(...) . When can that one be expected to cause problems? Does it really need to be implemented (I've seen version with question mark both before and after the parentheses with parameters like so: setDisabledState?(state: boolean): void { } but also like this: setDisabledState(state: boolean)?: void { } ).

","Read this article that explains the ControlValueAccessor in great details: Never again be confused when implementing ControlValueAccessor in Angular forms You usually need to implement ControlValueAcceessor interface on a component if it's supposed to be used as part of an Angular form. I commented out the second and third line of writeValue(...) methodand, as far I can tell, nothing broke. This is probably because you're not applying any form directive - formControl or ngModel that links a FormControl to your custom input component. The FormControl uses writeValue method of the InputComponent for communication. Here is the picture from the article I referenced above: The writeValue method is used by formControl to set value to the native form control. The registerOnChange method is used by formControl to register a callback that is expected to be triggered every time the native form control is updated. The registerOnTouched method is used to indicate that a user interacted with a control. Why is it important to execute the call to onChange(...) andonTouch(...) in writeValue(...)? What will go wrong and under whatcircumstances can it be expected?

As specified in the interface this function is called by the forms API when the control status changes to or from ""DISABLED"".

Question:
In this lecture on Forced Oscillations, Normal Modes, Resonances, Musical Instruments , the professor says that by moving a bow over a violin string, you expose it to a lot of frequencies. Is there a more precise explanation? I mean, when I move a bow in one direction orthogonally to a string, by friction a force is exerted on the string. So, when this force equals the force induced by the tension of the string, then an equilibrium is created and a displacement of the string results. No oscillation. So, where does these ""infinitely many frequencies"" come from? Later, the professor moves a tube in the air . However, here the motion is circular and so the direction of force exerted by the wind, at the top opening of the tube, will indeed pass by in an ocillating motion. So, this is a different excitation that the bow moving orthogonally in one direction. Also later, the professor bangs a tuning fork . In my opininion, banging is not a forced oscillation at all, it is a normal harmonic oscillation, where the bang are the initial conditions. Anyway, but what baffles me the most is the explanation of the violin string. So, could anybody explain more precisely why the bow ""exposes it to infinitely many frequencies""?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","In musical instruments, none of the excitations, whether by bowing, plucking, reed vibration, lip vibration, striking, etc, are sinusoidal methods. Therefore, they all, by Fourier's theorem are composed of multiple sine wave frequencies. If one or more of these frequencies corresponds to resonant frequencies of the instrument, the energy of those components will persist longer than other frequencies. If energy continues to be input to the instrument, the resonant frequencies will persist, giving rise to the continuing musical tone. Even a brief strike, like a mallet blow, has a time behavior, and resembles either a square, sawtooth, or triangle pulse, can be viewed as a pulse of multiple frequencies . It need not be a multiple period train. A single pulse induces the forcing function. Whether it affects the object depends on the damping of the object. Consider the striking of a tympani (low damping) versus a snare drum (higher damping). Some excitation methods, especially brass-instrument mouthpieces and reeds, begin the tone with multiple frequencies, then the reflected wave in the instrument creates a feedback loop, locking the lips or reed into resonant frequencies of the instrument. This is especially important for brass players, who can practice with a mouthpiece only playing a tune close to the actual pitches of the music. That way, they are adjusted to optimize the frequency feedback. The violin (and others) with bowing action is excited by a ""grab-release"" action of the resin-coated horse hair on the string. The action very strongly resembles a continual sawtooth wave plucking action. The string's length, tension, material, and thickness determine the resonant frequencies of the string, while the sawtooth wave, by Fourier's theorem, inputs more than enough frequencies to the string. The ones which match the resonant frequencies persist, while the ones which don't match dampen very quickly.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/611450', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/40876/']}",jdg_298830

Question:
Are there other life giving sources of energy in space apart from stars? (like nebulae, radiation, etc.)? Or are all possible life giving potential sources some variation of a star?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","There are three important sources of energy in planetary bodies (or their moons) that may be important in determining their suitability for life. All of these are evident in various bodies in the Solar System. The first is tidal heating. When one object orbits another then there will be gradient in the gravitational force across their finite sizes. If this is combined with any orbital non-circularity or difference  between rotational and orbital periods, along with some fluidity in the structure of one of the bodies, then it will be heated by frictional forces as the fluid moves in response to the changing gravitational gradient. This heating is most evident on Io in our own Solar System, the closest large moon of Jupiter, and is generally more important for objects orbiting close to more massive stars or planets. The second is heating by radioactive decay. When planetary systems are born, they can incorporate significant amounts of radioactive material. Some of this has a short half-life and may be responsible for a short period of intense heating, but other isotopes are much longer lived. According to this article , about 20 TW of power is generated inside the Earth from the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium and potassium. This sounds a lot, but is about a factor $10^4$ less power than we receive from the Sun. The third source is just the ""heat of formation"". Gathering together the raw materials of a planet/moon and compressing it into a gravitational potential well, inevitably leads to the generation of considerable heat and it can take billions of years for this heat to leak out into space. Indeed, for the Earth, the heat of formation is probably comparable with radioactive decay in terms of supplying energy to the surface from the interior.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/45491', 'https://astronomy.stackexchange.com', 'https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/users/42626/']}",jdg_205064

Question:
In Sinai's book on stochastic processes, the definition for discrete time stochastic processes is ""a sequence of random variables $\{X_{n}\}_{n\in{}T}$ defined on a common probability space $(\Omega,\mathcal{B},P)$"". While I think it makes sense that the sequence of random variables may share a commen state space $(\Omega,\mathcal{B})$, I'm wondering why they also share the same probability measure? Aren't the random variables supposed to have different distributions as they move along time? Can someone help explain where I am mistaken? Thank you!

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Careful. The distributions of the $X_n$ might be different or not. The distribution of $X_n$ is the probability measure $P\circ X_n^{-1}$. Now this is notationally elegant, but what it says is that for a Borel set $B\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, the distribution tells me how likely the value of $X_n$ lies in $B$. And that is $$P\big(\underbrace{\{\omega\in\Omega:X_n(\omega)\in B\}}_{X_n^{-1}}\big)=P\big(X_n^{-1}(B)\big).$$ So the distributions can be different even though the underlying probability space is the same.

Question:
Let $B_n$ be the braid group on $n$ strands. As is well known, if $\sigma_i$ is the operation of crossing the string in position $i$ over the string in position $i+1$, then the elements $\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_{n-1}$ generate $B_n$ and the relations $\sigma_i\sigma_j=\sigma_j\sigma_i$ ($|i-j|\geq 2$) and $\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}\sigma_i=\sigma_{i+1}\sigma_i\sigma_{i+1}$ give a presentation of the group. I am interested in a group that can be obtained from $B_n$ by adding another set of relations. For each $k$, define $T_k$ to be the ""twist"" of the first $k$ strands. Geometrically, you take hold of the bottom of the first $k$ strands and rotate your hand through 360 degrees in such a way that strands to the left go over strands to the right. In terms of the generators, $T_k=(\sigma_1\dots\sigma_{k-1})^k$, since $\sigma_1\dots\sigma_{k-1}$ takes the $k$th most strand and lays it across the next $k-1$ strands. Let us also define $S_k$ to be the right-over-left twist of the strands from $k+1$ to $n$. That is, $S_k=(\sigma_{k+1}\dots\sigma_{n-1})^{-(n-k)}$. (Also, let us take $T_1$ and $S_{n-1}$ to be the identity.) I am interested in the group you get if you start with $B_n$ and add in the relation $T_kS_k=1$ for every $k$. Let me make some utterly trivial observations. If $n=2$ then we get the cyclic group $C_2$. That's because $\sigma_1$ is the only generator and $T_2S_2=\sigma_1^2$. If $n=3$ then we get $S_3$. That's because $T_1S_1=\sigma_2^{-2}$ and $T_2S_2=\sigma_1^{-2}$, so the relations we are adding are $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$, and it is well known that those, together with the braid relations, give a presentation of the symmetric group. Beyond that I don't know what to say, though I've convinced myself (without a proof) that when $n=4$ the group is infinite: in general, it seems that the extra relations can be used to do only a limited amount of untwisting. (I do have a proof that there are pure braids that cannot be reduced to the identity once we have four strands. It's a fairly easy exercise and I won't give it here.) What exactly is my question? Well, I'd be interested to know whether the word problem in this group is soluble in reasonable time. In the service of that, I'd like to know whether this group is one that people have already looked at, or whether it at least belongs to a class of groups that people have already looked at. (E.g., perhaps the solubility of the word problem follows from some general theory.) And is there some nice way of characterizing the subgroup of $B_n$ that we are quotienting by? That is, which braids belong to the normal closure of the set of braids $T_kS_k$? (One way of answering this would be to characterize their normal forms.) The motivation for the question comes from part of an answer that Thurston gave to a question I asked about unknots. It seems to me that this question ought to be relevant to the untying of unknots, but easier. One final remark: the word problem in $B_n$ can be solved in polynomial time. (If my understanding is correct, this is a result of Thurston that built on work of Garside.) Since adding more relations makes more braids equal to the identity but also gives more ways of converting a word into another, it is not clear whether the problem I am asking should be easier or harder than the word problem for braid groups. However, my hunch is that it is harder (for large $n$, that is).

","Your group indeed will be infinite for $n>3$. The $n$-strand braid group is actually the mapping class group  of the $n$-punctured disk, which has a natural homomorphism to a finite index subgroup of the mapping class group of the $n+1$-punctured sphere. This is the subgroup that fixes a strand (the strand ""at infinity"" for the braid group, or corresponding to the boundary of the disk). This group is obtained from the braid group by quotienting by a full twist (this corresponds to twisting about the boundary of the disk, which is trivial in the mapping class group since it just fixes a puncture). Now, we have a further epimorphism to the $n$-punctured sphere mapping class group, by ""filling in"" the puncture at infinity. I claim that the image of $T_k$ and $S_k^{-1}$ in this group are the same. $T_k$ corresponds to a Dehn twist about a curve surrounding the strands $1,\ldots,k$. But on $S^2$, this curve is equivalent to the curve surrounding strands $k+1,\ldots, n$, and so the corresponding Dehn twists are equivalent. If you can show that the full twist is killed by your relators, then this must be the quotient group. Otherwise, I'm not quite sure what you get. I think I can show in $B_4$ that the full twist is killed by your relators, so the quotient of $B_4$ is the mapping class group of the 4-punctured sphere. Edit: Ryan Budney's answer shows what I expected, that you get the $n$-punctured sphere mapping class group.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/64629', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/1459/']}",jdg_99516

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","A relatively simple algorithm is to average the hues (in HSV or HSL) of the brightest and darkest pixels on the screen. In a pinch, go with the brightest pixel only. If the hues between brightest and darkest are too different, go with the bright pixel. If the dark is near black go with the bright pixel. Why even look at the dark pixel? Sometimes the dark is not near black, and hints at the ambient light or fog or haze. This will make sense to you if you're a heavy Photoshop user. Highlights in a photo are unrelated (or weakly related) to the underlying color of the object. They are your best representation of the color cast of the light, unless the image is so overexposed that everything has overwhelmed the CCDs. Then adjust the hues of all pixels. You'll need fast RGB to HSV and HSV to RGB functions. (But maybe you can work in RGB for the pixel corrections with a LUT or linear interpolation.) You don't want to go by average pixel color or most popular color. That way lies madness. To quickly find the brightest color (and the darkest one), you can work in RGB, but you should have multipliers for green, red, and blue. On an RGB monitor, 255 green is brighter than 255 red which is brighter than 255 blue. I used to have good multipliers in my head, but alas, they have fled my memory. You can probably google for them. This will fail in an image which has no highlights. A matte painted wall, for example. But I don't know what you can do about that. There are many improvements to make to this simple algorithm. You can average multiple bright pixels, grid the image and grab bright and dark pixels from each cell, etc. You'll find some obvious tweaks after implementing the algorithm.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/1175393', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/11708/']}",jdg_306104

Instead of conditionally load one implementation of the MyInterface interface at startup and then fire an event that triggers dynamic loading of another implementation of the same interface, I would tackle this problem in a different way, that is much simpler to implement and maintain. First of all, I'd just load all possible implementations: @Componentpublic class MyInterfaceImplementationsHolder {    @Autowired    private Map<String, MyInterface> implementations;    public MyInterface get(String impl) {        return this.implementations.get(impl);    }} This bean is just a holder for all implementations of the MyInterface interface. Nothing magic here, just common Spring autowiring behavior. Now, wherever you need to inject a specific implementation of MyInterface , you could do it with the help of an interface: public interface MyInterfaceReloader {    void changeImplementation(MyInterface impl);} Then, for every class that needs to be notified of a change of the implementation, just make it implement the MyInterfaceReloader interface. For instance: @Componentpublic class SomeBean implements MyInterfaceReloader {    // Do not autowire    private MyInterface myInterface;    @Override    public void changeImplementation(MyInterface impl) {        this.myInterface = impl;    }} Finally, you need a bean that actually changes the implementation in every bean that has MyInterface as an attribute: @Componentpublic class MyInterfaceImplementationUpdater {    @Autowired    private Map<String, MyInterfaceReloader> reloaders;    @Autowired    private MyInterfaceImplementationsHolder holder;    public void updateImplementations(String implBeanName) {        this.reloaders.forEach((k, v) ->             v.changeImplementation(this.holder.get(implBeanName)));    }} This simply autowires all beans that implement the MyInterfaceReloader interface and updates each one of them with the new implementation, which is retrieved from the holder and passed as an argument. Again, common Spring autowiring rules. Whenever you want the implementation to be changed, you should just invoke the updateImplementations method with the name of the bean of the new implementation, which is the lower camel case simple name of the class, i.e. myImplA or myImplB for classes MyImplA and MyImplB . You should also invoke this method at startup, so that an initial implementation is set on every bean that implements the MyInterfaceReloader interface.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/40105048', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4185276/']}",jdg_324733

","Unless func1 closes over funcArray , you cannot have it reach out and find func2 and execute it, nor should you. Even if func1 does close over funcArray , it would be poor separation of concerns for func1 to reach out and find itself in funcArray and then execute func2 . Instead, have other code that's in charge of running the functions. If they're synchronous If the functions complete their work synchronously, then it's simply: funcArray.forEach(fn => fn()); or for (const fn of funcArray) {    fn();} or if the result of one function should be passed to the next, you can use reduce : const finalResult = funcArray.reduce((previousResult, fn) => fn(previousResult), undefined); ...where undefined is the value to pass to func1 . If they're asynchronous If they don't do their work synchronously, you'll need to provide them a way to notify their caller that they've completed their work. Promises are a good, standard way to do that, but you could use simple callbacks instead. If you make them return promises, for instance, you can use the old promise reduce trick: funcArray.reduce((p, fn) => {    return p.then(() => {        fn();    });}, Promise.resolve()); or if the result of one function should be passed to the next: funcArray.reduce((p, fn) => {    return p.then(fn);}, Promise.resolve()); You can provide an argument to Promise.resolve to set the value to pass to func1 (without one, it'll receive undefined ).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/51822516', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/10219309/']}",jdg_91789

Question:
I believe it's a bug in notebook's comment parser. I can't comment strings with *) inside it. Something like: (*""this is a bug*)""*) I discovered it trying to comment a code with a regular expression RegularExpression[""((re)*)""] inside it. Can someone else check it? Using V10.0.2 in MacOS

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","We already have some answers explaining the issue. Let me give a solution to your problem. Let's say you have the code RegularExpression[""((re)*)""] that you want to comment out. Since we have nested comments in Mathematica , just use a pair of (* to prevent your issue: Although I don't know the internal implementation of Mathematicas parser, the reason why this goes wrong is pretty universal. Parsing is usually a two-step process. First, the input is broken down into tokens by a so-called lexer and comments are often separated from the rest of the code in this stage. Taking your example (* RegularExpression[""((re)*)""] *) this means the lexer first reads the token COMMENT_OPEN . Then, the lexer usually reads over everything until it meets the closing *) . And here it is important to know that the lexer really stupidly reads over the input. Unfortunately, the next closing *) is inside the stuff you wanted to comment out. At this point the lexer leaves its stupid comment mode again and tries to tokenize real code. Now, he is in the middle of your expression and everything goes wrong. Btw, using the fultzTokenize of this answer shows how Mathematica breaks your code down. Note that I had to quote the quotes accordingly. See that strings are kept together when the lexer is in code mode when going over str2 : str1=""(* RegularExpression[\""((re)*)\""] *)"";str2=""RegularExpression[\""((re)*)\""]"";fultzTokenize/@{str1,str2} {(*, ,RegularExpression,[,""((re),*),""] *)}  {     RegularExpression,[,""((re)*)"",]}",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/72244', 'https://mathematica.stackexchange.com', 'https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/2266/']}",jdg_316703

","In regards to Express 4, the ""after"" function from your second example never gets called because the middle function never calls next().

Question:
I just proved that subgroups of solvable groups are solvable. So given that $G$ is solvable there is $1=G_0 \unrhd G_1 \unrhd \cdots \unrhd G_s=G$ where $G_{i+1}/G_i$ is abelian and for $N$ a normal subgroup we know it is solvable so there is $1=N_0 \unrhd N_1 \unrhd \cdots \unrhd N_{r}=N$ where $N_{i+1}/N_i$ is abelian. I'm trying to construct the chain for the entire group $G/N$ using the Lattice Isomorphism Theorem but am stuck. Is it possible to do this?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The ""standard"" proof: Consider, for each $i$, the subgroups $G_iN/N$ of $G/N$. It is straight-forward to show that $G_iN$ is normal in $G_{i+1}N$ (and thus $G_iN/N$ is normal in $G_{i+1}N/N$). Now $\dfrac{G_{i+1}N/N}{G_iN/N} \cong G_{i+1}N/G_iN$. Taking any $x,y \in G_{i+1}$, and $n,n' \in N$, we see that: $[xn(G_iN),yn'(G_iN)] = [xn,yn']G_iN$, and since $N \lhd G$, $[xn,yn'] \in [x,y]N$, so that: $[xn,yn']G_iN = [xn,yn']NG_i = ([xn,yn']N)G_i = $ $([x,y]N)G_i = [x,y]NG_i = [x,y]G_iN = ([x,y]G_i)N$. Since $G_{i+1}/G_i$ is abelian, $[x,y]G_i = G_i$ so $[xn,yn']G_iN = G_iN$,so that $G_{i+1}N/G_iN$ is abelian, as desired. (here, $[x,y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ and we are using the fact that for a group $G$, $G$ is abelian iff $[x,y] = e$ for all $x,y \in G$). It should be noted that some of the quotients $G_{i+1}N/G_iN$ may be trivial, resulting in a shorter subnormal series for $G/N$.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1339609', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/240037/']}",jdg_169561

Question:
I need to setup a 2 way SSL communication channel between a .NET/WCF application and a third party web server. Right now I am trying get a successful handshake with the host in order to validate that all the elements are setup correctly (client certificate, server certificate authority, network communication...). I'm using the openSSL command line tool to try and validate this, using the s_client command. Here is what is stopping me, and what I don't understand: whatever I do, openSSL is expecting to find a private key for the client certificate the client certificate was given to me by the third party, but itdoes not contain any private key if I just generate my own private key file using openSSL, I'm gettinga key values mismatch error Keep in mind that I have just started getting my hands into SSL so I have a very basic understanding of the whole protocol. From what I've been reading, it seems that both server and client need their private key in a 2 way SSL setting. However, I can't figure out how to get a working private key on my client (working with the client certificate that was given to me).I would very much appreciate if somebody could shed some light on client certificate private keys, as this is giving me a major headache.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Certificates on their own are only public pieces of information. What links a public key certificate to the name it contains is the fact that whoever has legitimate control over that name (e.g. your name or your server's name) also has the private key for it. Certificates are used to prove the identity of the remote party by challenging the remote party to perform an operation that can only be done with the corresponding private key: signing something (which can be verified with the public key) or deciphering something that was encrypted with the public key. (Both can happen in the SSL/TLS handshake, depending on the cipher suite.) During the SSL/TLS handshake, the server sends its certificate (in clear) and proves to the client that it has the corresponding private key using an authenticated key exchange . In your case, you also want to use client-certificate authentication. It's not enough to send the client certificate during the handshake: the client must also prove it has the private key. Otherwise, anyone who receives that certificate could clone it. The point of using certificates is to prevent any cloning, in such a way that you never have to show your own secret (the private key). More specifically, the client has to sign the handshake messages in the Certificate Verify message of the TLS handshake so that the server can verify it against the public key sent in the client certificate. Without this step, no client-certificate authentication would be taking place. the client certificate was given to me by the third party, but it doesnot contain any private key Giving you your certificate without its private key seems a bit pointless, unless you're expected to have generated a certificate request on your side beforehand (in which case you would have the private key). Indeed, rather than being given a certificate and its private key, it's better practice for you to generate your key-pair, create a certificate request (CSR), and have your CA issue a certificate from that CSR (but without them ever knowing your private key). In this case, you would be expected to have kept your private key, and you would be able to use it with the cert you would have received.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/11199099', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1349107/']}",jdg_271711

Drawing code works like this: You start by calling the function beginCircuit(x,y) . Inside the parenthesis, put the x and y coordinates you want to start your circuit at, like so: beginCircuit(200,100) . This will draw a wire, and a battery at the coordinates you specified (in pixels). The battery and wire together take up 100 pixels of space on the screen. Then, you can call any of the following functions: drawWire(length) Draws a wire of the length you specify at the end of the circuit. Takes up length amount of space. turnClockwise(length) Turns the direction in which your next command will draw 90° clockwise. Takes up no space. turnCounterClockwise(length) Turns the direction in which your next command will draw 90° counter-clockwise. Takes up no space. drawCapacitor(length) Draws a capacitor at the end of the circuit. Takes up 50px. drawInductor(length) Draws an inductor at the end of the circuit. Takes up 50px. drawResistor(length) Draws a resistor at the end of the circuit. Takes up 50px. drawTrimmer(length) Draws a resistor at the end of the circuit. Takes up 50px. When you're done drawing circuitry, use the function endCircuit() to close and then draw the circuit. It will automatically draw a wire from the point where you stopped to the beginning of the circuit. I know it's a lot to do, but it really is a very easy and flexible way to do this once you understand it. If you want to see this in action, go here: http://jsfiddle.net/mindoftea/ZajVE/ .  Please give it a shot, and if you have problems, comment about it, please.

Perl 6 seems to have an explosion of equality operators. What is =:= ? What's the difference between leg and cmp ? Or eqv and === ? Does anyone have a good summary?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","=:= tests if two containers (variables or items of arrays or hashes) are aliased, ie if one changes, does the other change as well? my $x;my @a = 1, 2, 3;# $x =:= @a[0] is false$x := @a[0];# now $x == 1, and $x =:= @a[0] is true$x = 4;# now @a is 4, 2, 3 As for the others: === tests if two references point to the same object, and eqv tests if two things are structurally equivalent. So [1, 2, 3] === [1, 2, 3] will be false (not the same array), but [1, 2, 3] eqv [1, 2, 3] will be true (same structure). leg compares strings like Perl 5's cmp , while Perl 6's cmp is smarter and will compare numbers like <=> and strings like leg . 13 leg 4   # -1, because 1 is smaller than 4, and leg converts to string13 cmp 4   # +1, because both are numbers, so use numeric comparison. Finally ~~ is the ""smart match"", it answers the question ""does $x match $y "". If $y is a type, it's type check.

Question:
I'm using Clang 3.8 to compile one file that comes from a different source in a project. This is a temporary crutch, as this file is an addition to a library that I also use, and the code it has will be part of that library's next release. However, these people develop with less stringent warning flags than I do. I'm not interested in these warnings as they're benign, I don't maintain that file, and it'll go away within a few months. Of course, I can selectively remove a warning or two, but I think that it makes more sense in this case to disable all and every warnings that it generates because I could change the warning settings of my project later and more occurrences could come out of it. I've tried #pragma clang diagnostic ignored ""-Weverything"" , but Clang warns that -Weverything is an unknown warning group. How can I ask Clang to not generate any warnings for that file?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Indeed, the ""-Weverything"" is not a group of warnings, but just a special option passed to the compiler. Here is code that handles this case: lib/Basic/Warnings.cpp:118 You still can compile your problematic source file using slightly different rules/flags as you use for others sources: clang -Wno-everything foo.c However, I'd recommend to disable each warning explicitly using #pragma . In case you disable all warnings, and then upgrade your compiler, then you may miss some new warnings, which could be important (e.g. undefined behaviour checks, security checks, etc). Also, imagine what happens if the file is not gone after three months, but stays in the project forever.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/37421494', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/251153/']}",jdg_206023

Question:
Was discussing with a friend: suppose we have one model that uses 1,000 features and another that uses 100,000 features.  Assuming their first 1,000 features are the same, shouldn't the one with 100,000 features always do at least as well as the 1,000 feature model? I say this because, if there's a correlation between an additional feature and the target variable, it can learn this.  If there's no correlation, the model should learn to ignore.  So more features should always be at least as good as a model with only a subset of the same features. My friend claims features can actively hamper model performance so that more isn't always better...how is this possible? Thanks!

","Calculating predicted probabilities using a Cox model There is a way of obtaining prediction out of a Cox model, as survival probability at time $t$ ( $S(t)$ ) depends on your cox model like so: $S(t) = e^{-H_0(t) * exp(LP)}$ in this formula $H_0(t)$ is called the baseline hazard at time $t$ ; and $LP$ is the linear predictor. If $X_i$ are the predictor variables $1,2,...,i$ in the Cox model, and $β_i$ are the corresponding coefficients from the Cox model, then the linear predictor is calculated like so: $LP = X_1*β_1 + X_2*β_2 + ... + X_i*β_i$ You might already be familiar with what a linear predictor is, but I added this for clarity sake. The baseline hazard is a little harder to obtain. Basically it is a function of time, which shows the hazard for an event of an individual who has a $LP$ of 0. Due to the way cox regression works this value is not estimated (look at this CV question or others, which sheds more light on baseline hazard). In R however (which I can see the OP uses), there is a function available called 'basehaz()' in the survival package, which will let you extract the baseline hazard at a specific timepoint based on your model's fit.If you extract this baseline hazard you can complete the formula above for any individual in your data, and for unseen data, as long as you are able to calculate the linear predictor for these individuals. Remember this formula results in the probability of survival or not having had the event at time $t$ . If you want to know the probability of an event at time $t$ , simply subtract the probability from 1: $P(event|LP) = 1-S(t) = 1 - e^{-H_0(t) * exp(LP)}$ Final remark: Note that the basehaz function gives you a baseline hazard at time $t$ based on your specific data . So, as is the case for the coefficients, extrapolating this to new cases might not result in a good fit/prediction, due to overfitting, bias, etc. Calibration & Discrimination With the predicted probabilities and the event status at one year you can calculate various calibration statistics. For the discrimination statistic (the c-index) there is a specific kind of rank correlation for a censored response variable. In R, the rcorr.cens function from the Hmisc package can provide you with it. Whether these statistics are the most suitable for your research I can not say, as that depends mostly on the specifics (e.g. are you building a new and first model for this setting, or are you comparing to previously developed ones?)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/291258', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/79541/']}",jdg_265603

Question:
I'm looking for a few kernel modules to load i2c-dev and i2c-bcm2708 . But the modprobe command returns: sudo modprobe i2c-devmodprobe: module i2c-dev not found in modules.dep How do I list all the available modules in the system? In which directory are they located?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","By default modprobe loads modules from kernel subdirectories located in the /lib/modules/$(uname -r) directory. Usually all files have extension .ko , so you can list them with find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -type f -name '*.ko' or, taking into account compressed files: find /lib/modules/$(uname -r) -type f -name '*.ko*' Each module can be also loaded by referring to its aliases, stored in the /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.alias (and modules.alias.bin ). However, to load a modules successfully modprobe needs their dependencies listed in the file /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/modules.dep (and a corresponding binary version modules.dep.bin ). If some module is present on the system, but is not on the list, then you should run a command depmod which will generate such dependencies and automatically include your module to modules.dep and modules.dep.bin . Additionally, if the module is successfully loaded it will be listed in the file /proc/modules (also accessed via command lsmod ).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/184877', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/65903/']}",jdg_215744

","It's possible you initialize prod to 0, which means no matter what numbers are in your array, prod will remain 0.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","""Currently logged in"" is something you can't do with plain old sessions. Let me explain why: A session is a bunch of data stored at server side which is assigned to an user through a cookie. That cookie remains on user browser and so it keeps the session active. Sessions can stay ""alive"" months without the user even logging in. But, it's possible to store sessions on database . As you can see, Laravel keeps a field called last_activity and, through that field, you should be able to retrieve all sessions that had activity within the last 15 minutes (or something else, you call it). When your retrieve those records, the data field is a serialized representation of session data. You can unserialize($session_record->data) and retrieve the user id. Depending on your Auth driver, session's user id may have different names: For eloquent driver, it should be eloquent_login . For fluent driver fluent_login . For your Custom\AuthClass , it should be called custom_authclass_login .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/15632144', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/167685/']}",jdg_248521

","I am trying to match multiple CSS style code blocks in a HTML document. Standard Answer: don't use regex to parse HTML. regex cannot parse HTML reliably, no matter how complicated and clever you make your expression. Unless you are absolutely sure the exact format of the target document is totally fixed, string or regex processing is insufficient and you must use an HTML parser. (<style type=""text/css"">)(.*)(</style>) That's a greedy expression. The (.*) in the middle will match as much as it possibly can. If you have two style blocks: <style type=""text/css"">1</style> <style type=""text/css"">2</style> then it will happily match '1</style> <style type=""text/css"">2'. Use (.*?) to get a non-greedy expression, which will allow the trailing (</style>) to match at the first opportunity. Should I call the 'find' method to get the next match? Yes, and you should have used it to get the first match too. The usual idiom is: while (matcher.find()) {    s= matcher.group(n);} Note that standard string processing (indexOf, etc) may be a simpler approach for you than regex, since you're only using completely fixed strings.

Question:
I'm considering encrypting some small files (hundreds of kb apiece) using the AES Crypt reference implementation. Looking at the source, it seems that the encryption key is derived from the IV and the password by concatenating the two into a buffer which is then repeatedly hashed. So the IV is acting as the ""salt"" for the hash. By repeatedly, I mean 8192 times. I understand that the benefit of this is to increase the time required to generate the key, making it more expensive to perform brute-force attacks to discover the password. I also understand that the drawback is that it takes longer to do the legitimate encryption and decryption tasks for the real users. Further, as both the users and attackers buy faster machines over time, the benefit and drawback will tend to zero. So my question is, given current computer capability, and assuming a motivated attacker who doesn't own a dedicated cluster, is 8192 iterations insufficient, overkill, or ""just right""? Also, have a missed anything in my analysis of this key generation: is there some other reason for choosing such a number of iterations that makes it a good choice?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","RSA's standard for password-based cryptography recommends ""at least 1000"" iterations, so the factor seems to be in the ballpark. With 8192 iterations, you are essentially increasing the time needed to complete a brute-force attack by a factor equivalent to adding 13 bits of entropy to the password or 2 alphanumeric characters (with respect to brute-force attacks only). This is a good way of thinking about it because it is independent of increasing computational power. The question is: given the security of the passwords you or your users will be using, is it feasible to brute-force it? If you add 13-bits to it, is it feasible to brute-force it? If your users are using strong passwords, the answer is probably no to both. If your users are using a dictionary word, 13-bits is probably not enough to push it into secure territory.

Question:
Suppose we have the random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ that have Bernoulli distributions with the (possibly different) probabilities $p_1, \ldots, p_n$. For example, $X_1$ = 1 with probability $p_1$ and 0 with probability $1-p_1$. Is there an efficient way to compute $$E\left[\frac{1}{1+\sum_iX_i}\right]$$ in polynomial time in $n$? If not, is there an approximate solution?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","An approach is through generating functions. For every nonnegative random variable $S$,$$E\left(\frac1{1+S}\right)=\int_0^1E(t^S)\mathrm{d}t.$$If $S=X_1+\cdots+X_n$ and the random variables $X_i$ are independent, $E(t^S)$ is the product of the $E(t^{X_i})$. If furthermore $X_i$ is Bernoulli $p_i$,$$E\left(\frac1{1+S}\right)=\int_0^1\prod_{i=1}^n(1-p_i+p_it)\mathrm{d}t.$$This is an exact formula. I do not know how best to use it to compute the LHS efficiently. Of course one can develop the integrand in the RHS, getting a sum of $2^n$ terms indexed by the subsets $I$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ as$$E\left(\frac1{1+S}\right)=\sum_I\frac1{|I|+1}\prod_{i\in I}p_i\cdot\prod_{j\notin I}(1-p_j).$$But it might be more useful to notice that$$\prod_{i=1}^n(1-p_i+p_it)=\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^k\sigma_k(\mathbf{p})(1-t)^k,$$where $\sigma_0(\mathbf{p})=1$ and $(\sigma_k(\mathbf{p}))_{1\le k\le n}$ are the symmetric polynomials of the family $\mathbf{p}=\{p_i\}_i$. Integrating with respect to $t$, one gets$$E\left(\frac1{1+S}\right)=\sum_{k=0}^n(-1)^k\frac{\sigma_k(\mathbf{p})}{k+1}.$$The computational burden is reduced to the determination of the sequence $(\sigma_k(\mathbf{p}))_{1\le k\le n}$. Note 1 The last formula is an integrated version of the algebraic identity stating that, for every family $\mathbf{x}=\{x_i\}_i$ of zeroes and ones,$$\frac1{1+\sigma_1(\mathbf{x})}=\sum_{k\ge0}(-1)^k\frac{\sigma_k(\mathbf{x})}{k+1},$$truncated at $k=n$ since, when at most $n$ values of $x_i$ are non zero, $\sigma_k(\mathbf{x})=0$ for every $k\ge n+1$. To prove the algebraic identity, note that, for every $k\ge0$, $$\sigma_1(\mathbf{x})\sigma_k(\mathbf{x})=k\sigma_k(\mathbf{x})+(k+1)\sigma_{k+1}(\mathbf{x}),$$ and compute the product of $1+\sigma_1(\mathbf{x})$ by the series in the RHS. To apply this identity to our setting, introduce $\mathbf{X}=\{X_i\}_i$ and note that, for every $k\ge0$, $$E(\sigma_k(\mathbf{X}))=\sigma_k(\mathbf{p}).$$ Note 2 More generally, for every suitable complex number $z$,$$\frac1{z+\sigma_1(\mathbf{x})}=\sum_{k\ge0}(-1)^k\frac{\Gamma(k+1)\Gamma(z)}{\Gamma(k+1+z)}\sigma_k(\mathbf{x}).$$",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/38662', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/9230/']}",jdg_323935

We form a matrix consisting of those two vectors like this:\begin{bmatrix}    3 & -1 & 1 & 1 \\    1 & 3 & -1 & 1 \\\end{bmatrix}Then we transform that matrix to row echelon form by $II-3\cdot I$ transformation:\begin{bmatrix}    3 & -1 & 1 & 1 \\    0 & \frac{10}{3} & -\frac{4}{3} & \frac{2}{3} \\\end{bmatrix}We can see that the rank of that matrix is $2$, so it has two linearly independent rows. Does that answer the question of linear independence of those two vectors? The reason I'm asking this is because my professor checked their linear independence by forming a matrix of this form:\begin{bmatrix}    3 & 1 \\    -1 & 3 \\    1 & -1 \\    1 & 1 \\\end{bmatrix}Then reduced it to row echelon form:\begin{bmatrix}    3 & 1 \\    0 & \frac{10}{3} \\    0 & 0 \\    0 & 0 \\\end{bmatrix}which is equal to the system:$$3x+y=0$$$$\frac{10}{3}y=0$$so $x=0$ and $y=0$, which means those two vectors are independent.

Question:
I have a file named my_file.txt whose content is just the string Hello . How could I redirect its content to the command echo ? I know I have the commands less , cat , more ... but I need to do it with echo . I tried this: $ cat my_file.txt | echo and also this: $ echo < my_file.txt But in both cases it appears only a blank in the stdout, not the content of my_file.txt. How could I do that?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You can redirect all you want to echo but it won't do anything with it. echo doesn't read its standard input. All it does is write to standard output its arguments separated by a space character and terminated by a newline character (and with some echo implementations with some escape sequences in them expanded and/or arguments starting with - possibly treated as options). If you want echo to display the content of a file, you have to pass that content as an argument to echo . Something like: echo ""$(cat my_file.txt)"" Note that $(...) strips the trailing newline character s from the output of that cat command, and echo adds one back. Also note that except with zsh , you can't pass NUL characters in the arguments of a command, so that above will typically not work with binary files. yash will also remove bytes that don't form part of valid characters. If the reason for wanting to do that is because you want echo to expand the \n , \b , \0351 ... escape sequences in the file (as UNIX conformant echo implementations do, but not all ), then you'd rather use printf instead : printf '%b\n' ""$(cat my_file.txt)"" Contrary to echo , that one is portable and won't have problems if the content of the file starts with - . As an alternative to $(cat file) , with ksh , zsh and bash , one can also do: $(<file) . That's a special operator whereby the shell as opposed to cat reads the content of the  file to make up the expansion. It still strips the trailing newlines and chokes on NUL bytes except in zsh . In bash , that still forks an extra process. Also note that one difference is that you won't get any error if trying to read a file of type directory that way. Also, while $(< file) is special, $(< file; other command) is not (in zsh , when not emulating other shell, that would still expand the content of the file , by running the implicit $READNULLCMD command (typically a pager)).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/63658', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/31748/']}",jdg_113272

","I think there are a lot of different ways to specify this problem. For simplicity, consider independent Garch processes$$r_{1,t} \sim N\left(0,\sigma_{1,t}^{2}\right)$$$$\sigma_{1,t}^{2} = \beta_{1,1}+\beta_{1,2}\varepsilon_{1,t-1}^{2}+\beta_{1,3}\sigma_{1,t-1}^{2}$$and $$r_{2,t} \sim N\left(0,\sigma_{2,t}^{2}\right)$$$$\sigma_{2,t}^{2} = \beta_{2,1}+\beta_{2,2}\varepsilon_{2,t-1}^{2}+\beta_{2,3}\sigma_{2,t-1}^{2}$$where $\left[\begin{array}{cc}\varepsilon_{1,t} & \varepsilon_{2,t}\end{array}\right]\sim N\left(0,\left[\begin{array}{cc}1 & 0\\0 & 1\end{array}\right]\right)$.

Question:
I am trying to prove that algebraic numbers are countably infinite, and I have a hint to use: after fixing the degree of the polynomial, consider summing the absolute values of its integer coefficients, and setting the sum less than or equal to $m$, for each $m \in \mathbb{N}$. I am also allowed to use the fact that every polynomial has a finite number of roots. I am not sure where to begin... Perhaps after fixing the degree of the polynomials, I could try enumerating them, and after proving countability of the set that contains the roots of all polynomials of a certain degree, I could state that the union of infinitely many ($\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}$, $n \in \mathbb{N}$) countably infinite sets is countable, and thus the algebraic numbers are countably infinite, too, but I am not sure if this is a good approach/how to enumerate the polynomials. Thanks!

","The hint pretty much tells you what to do. First, consider the polynomials of degree $1$ in which the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients is $1$; there's only finitely many of them, each with finitely many roots. (Think of this collection as corresponding to the pair $(1,1)$, the first $1$ giving the degree, the second $1$ giving the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients). Then, consider the polynomials of degree $2$ whose sum of the absolute value of the coefficients is $1$; again, only finitely many, each with finitely many roots; make this set correspond to $(2,1)$. Then, the polynomials of degree $1$ whose sum of the absolute value of the coefficients is $2$; only finitely many, each with finitely many roots. The set corresponds to the pair $(1,2)$. Then consider the pair $(3,1)$; then the pair $(2,2)$; then the pair $(1,3)$. Then move on to the pair $(4,1)$, followed by $(3,2)$, followed by $(2,3)$, followed by $(1,4)$. Etc. This will ensure that you cover each and every polynomial of positive degree with integer coefficients after finitely many steps; many algebraic numbers will occur more than once, but that's not a problem to showing they are at most countable (that they are infinite should be trivial).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/50655', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/12052/']}",jdg_272368

Question:
How would one prove that the expected value of the residuals from OLS regression is zero? I will make two cases. In the first case I treat $X_i$ as random and in the second case I treat it is non-random. First case. We know that $\hat{u}_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$ . Taking the expectation, $E[\hat{u}_i] = E[y_i] - E[\hat{y}_i]$ . Now, we know from the solution of the OLS minimisation problem $\bar{y}_i = \bar{\hat{y}}_i$ because $\bar{\hat{u}} = 0$ . If we take the probability limits, $plim \: \bar{y}_i = plim \: \bar{\hat{y}}_i$ . By the law of large numbers this leads to $E[y_i] = E[\hat{y}_i]$ . Hence, $E[\hat{u}_i] = 0$ . Is this proof correct? Besides, how would one interpret $E[\hat{u}_i]$ ? $\hat{u}_i$ results from a given sample. Expectation is a population concept. If we take the expectation of a residual, what would this represent? The sample means of a residual term in the long run or population? Second case. This is easy. $E[\hat{u}] = E[My] = E[M{u}] = ME[{u}] = 0$ because $My = MXB+Mu$ and $MX = 0$ , because $X$ is non-random and hence can be taken out of the expectation operator, and because $E[u] = 0$ . Here $M = I - P$ projection matrix. But my question is not about this case where $X$ is non-random, but the first case above where it is random.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Using OLS estimation, the residuals can be written using the hat matrix $\mathbf{h} = \boldsymbol{X} (\boldsymbol{X}^\text{T} \boldsymbol{X})^{-1} \boldsymbol{X}^\text{T}$ as follows: $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned}\mathbf{r} &= (\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{h}) \boldsymbol{Y} \\[6pt]&= (\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{h}) (\boldsymbol{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}) \\[6pt]&= (\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{h}) \boldsymbol{X} \boldsymbol{\beta} + (\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{h}) \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \\[6pt]&= \mathbb{0} + (\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{h}) \boldsymbol{\varepsilon} \\[6pt]&= (\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{h}) \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}. \\[6pt]\end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ So, assuming the error terms have zero mean, you have: $$\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{r}|\boldsymbol{X}) = \mathbb{E}((\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{h}) \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}|\boldsymbol{X}) = (\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{h}) \mathbb{E}(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}|\boldsymbol{X}) = \mathbf{0}.$$",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/369658', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/97791/']}",jdg_79078

This is a neat little problem that I was discussing today with my lab group out at lunch. Not particularly difficult but interesting implications nonetheless Imagine there are a 100 people in line to board a plane that seats 100. The first person in line, Alice, realizes she lost her boarding pass, so when she boards she decides to take a random seat instead. Every person that boards the plane after her will either take their ""proper"" seat, or if that seat is taken, a random seat instead. Question: What is the probability that the last person that boards will end up in their proper seat? Moreover, and this is the part I'm still pondering about.

This is because the last person will either get the first seat or the last seat. Any other seat will necessarily be taken by the time the last person gets to 'choose'. Since at each choice step, the first or last is equally probable to be taken, the last person will get either the first or last with equal probability: $\frac{1}{2}$ .

I have a unit test method, which invokes some asynchronous code, which in turn ultimately engages a BackgroundWorker to which I am able to pass a completion handler. All the code is mine, so I can change the implementation if I wish to. I am not going, however, to replace the BackgroundWorker , because it automatically uses the right synchronization context, so that when the code is invoked on a UI thread the completion callback is invoked on the same UI thread, which is very good. Anyway, it is possible that the unit test method hits the end before the BW finishes its work, which is not good. So I wish to wait until the BW completes and would like to know the best way for it.

","You are essentially correct in your last paragraph: Is the sole purpose for authentication purposes so that one who has a public key knows that this piece of encrypted hash information is signed by the person that issues this public key (has the private key) since he/she is able to decrypt it. Though, as mentioned in comments, and in various places around the internet, the idea that a signature is ""signing with the private key"" is not quite right, it's like saying that a motorcycle is a mechanical horse; it's kinda right (and if you're talking to someone from the year 1685 then it's probably the best you can do) but it's also completely wrong. So I'm not sure where you got that image from, but I would be wary about anything else they've said, since they are clearly over-simplifying. I think you already have the core idea, but I'll try to add some more context. Let's say you're in some sketchy foreign country and a complete stranger walks up to you and says ""Hi @Noob, I have a letter for you from your mother."" Before you open the letter there are two things you probably want to know: 1) did this letter really come from your mother? And 2) did anyone modify it before giving it to you? In information security these questions are known as authenticity and integrity , respectively. Digital signatures accomplish both authenticity and integrity , let's talk about integrity first. Data Integrity With this question we want to prove that the message has not been intercepted and modified while in transit. To do this we will use cryptographic hash functions with the idea that if two messages have the same hash code, then with a 99.99...% chance they are the same message. (The 0.0...01% chance that two properly formatted English messages have the same hash is actually exploitable, and is called a hash collision attack , but we'll ignore that here.) So when I send a message, I'm going to attach to it a hash of the message so that the recipient can compute their own hash of the message and check that they match (that's the right-hand-side of your image ""Identical hash validates data integrity""). But what's to stop the mail-man from replacing both the message and the hash with new ones? Well, we'll solve that at the same time that we solve authentication. Data Authentication In this question we want to prove that the message which claims to be from your mother, did actually come from your mother. To do this, we usually get the sender to include something that only they could have done, for example you sign paper by scribbling your name in a way that nobody else could possibly copy, ancient kings would press their rings into wax (assuming that nobody else has a copy of that ring). With digital signatures we are going to sign a small piece of sample data and send it along, that way anybody can try decrypting it with the public key in the sender's certificate and make sure that it matches the original sample data. Now, instead of signing any random piece of data, we'll sign the hash of the message and kill two birds with one stone. When we check that decode(received_hash, sender_public_key) == hash(received_message) we are actually verifying both authenticity and integrity in the same step, since the only way this will pass is if the sender owns the matching private key and the message has not been modified. ~~ Edit in response to your comment: ~~ How do I know that the public key that I have is actually for my friend, and not for an attacker pretending to be my friend? That's what certificates are for. The question has a different answer depending on the type of trust model we're using, so let's look at the two main ones: Web of Trust This is the system used by PGP where each user creates a certificate for them self and gives it to their buddies. The first time you give your cert to someone you have to do it carefully, like on a USB stick in person, or once they have it, have them encrypt something for you and make sure you can decrypt it properly. Once you have a certificate that you trust for someone, then you can encrypt for them and verify their signatures without any problem. There's also the Network of Trust (aka ""Web of Trust"") idea: you can add your signature to anyone's key to endorse that it's genuine. Let's say I'm good friends with Bob, and he has endorsed Alice's cert, then I'm probably OK to trust Alice's cert. Hierarchical Trust - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) This model gets it's trust by having all certificates generated by trusted servers (called Certificate Authorities). In this model, the job of the CA is to make sure that the person is who they claim to be, before issuing the cert to them. For example, if someone submits a request for a certificate tying pub_key to bob@example.com and 1-800-123-4567 , then the CA might send a one-time code to bob@example.com and make sure he can get it, and might try calling 1-800-123-4567 and ask ""did you just order a cert?""",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/93603', 'https://security.stackexchange.com', 'https://security.stackexchange.com/users/80718/']}",jdg_230437

Question:
Selinger (""A survery of graphical languages for monoidal categories"", 2009) defines a ""spacial monoidal category"" as one that satisifies the following string-diagram axiom This diagram says that for every $h : I \to I$ and object $A$ , $$ \rho_A \circ (\text{id}_A \otimes h) \circ \rho^{-1}_A =  \lambda_A \circ (h \otimes \text{id}_A) \circ \lambda_A^{-1},$$ where $\lambda_A$ and $\rho_A$ are the left and right unitors. What is an example of a monoidal category that is not spacial by this definition?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","One of the simplest examples of a non-spacial category is $\mathrm{End}(\mathrm{Vec}^{\oplus 2})$ , the category of $2\times2$ matrices with vector space coefficients. Working over a field $\mathbb k$ , this is a multifusion category with four simple objects: $$ \begin{pmatrix} \mathbb k & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \mathbb k \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ \mathbb k & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \mathbb k \end{pmatrix}$$ and the tensor product is just matrix multiplication (with tensor product and direct sum of vector spaces, of course). The monoidal unit is not simple: $$ \mathbb{1} = \begin{pmatrix} \mathbb k & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \oplus \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \mathbb k \end{pmatrix}.$$ In particular, the endomorphisms of the monoidal unit is the commutative ring $\mathbb k \oplus \mathbb k$ (with componentwise addition and multiplication). Consider the endomorphism $$ h = (\alpha,\beta) \in \mathrm{End}(\mathbb 1)$$ and object $$ A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & \mathbb k \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.$$ Then one of your diagrams evaluates to $\alpha \, \mathrm{id}_A$ and the other one evaluates to $\beta \, \mathrm{id}_A$ . Remark: Write $R = \mathrm{End}(\mathbb 1) = \mathbb k \oplus \mathbb k$ . Then it is an associative $\mathbb k$ -algebra, and the multifusion category above is the monoidal category of $R$ - $R$ bimodules. Categories of bimodules are typically not spacial except when the algebra has trivial (i.e. one-dimensional) centre. A fun example to think through is to consider $\mathbb C$ as an $\mathbb R$ -algebra. Then the category of $\mathbb C$ - $\mathbb C$ bimodules has two simple objects ( Exercise: why?), and is not spacial ( Exercise: why not?).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/345239', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/128281/']}",jdg_331476

Question:
I am currently faced with a difficult sorting problem. I have a collection of events that need to be sorted against each other (a comparison sort ) and against their relative position in the list. In the simplest terms I have list of events that each have a priority (integer), a duration (seconds), and an earliest occurrence time that the event can appear in the list. I need to sort the events based on priority, but no event can appear in the list before its earliest occurrence time. Here's an example to (hopefully) make it clearer: // Psuedo C# codeclass Event { int priority; double duration; double earliestTime ; }void Example(){    Event a = new Event { priority = 1, duration = 4.0, earliestTime = 0.0 };    Event b = new Event { priority = 2, duration = 5.0, earliestTime = 6.0 };    Event c = new Event { priority = 3, duration = 3.0, earliestTime = 0.0 };    Event d = new Event { priority = 4, duration = 2.0, earliestTime = 0.0 };    // assume list starts at 0.0 seconds    List<Event> results = Sort( new List<Event> { a, b, c, d } );    assert( results[ 0 ] == a ); // 4.0 seconds elapsed    assert( results[ 1 ] == c ); // 7.0 seconds elapsed    assert( results[ 2 ] == b ); // 12.0 seconds elapsed    assert( results[ 3 ] == d ); // 14.0 seconds elapsed} Item ""b"" has to come last because it isn't allowed to start until 6.0 seconds into the list, so it is deferred and ""c"" gets to go before ""b"" even though its priority is lower. (Hopefully the above explains my problem, if not let me know and I'll edit it.) My current idea is to use an insertion sort to manage the sorting process. Unlike many of the other common sorting algorithms, insertion sort decides the order of the list one at a time and in order. So for each index I should be able to find the next lowest priority event whose earliest occurrence time will be satisfied. I'm hoping to find resources about sorting algorithms and data structures to help me design a good solution for this ""sort"" of problem. My real problem is actually more complex than this: hierarchical sorting, variable buffers between events, multiple non-constant time constraints, so the more information or ideas the better. Speed and space are not really a concern. Accuracy in sorting and maintainability of the code are a concern. Edit: Clarifications (based on comments) Events consume their entire duration (that is there is no overlap of events allowed) Events must occur at or after their earliestTime, they cannot occur before their earliestTime. Events can occur later than their earliestTime if lower priority events exist Events cannot be interrupted There is a maximum duration the sum of all events that can fit in a list. This is not shown above. (In reality the duration of all events will be far greater than the time list's maximum duration.) There cannot be any gaps. (There are no holes to try and back fill.) Edit: Answer While David Nehme gave the answer I selected, I wanted to point out that his answer is an insertion sorts at heart, and several other people provided insertions sort type answers. This confirms for me that a specialized insertion sort is probably the way to go. Thanks to all of you for your answers.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","This is actually more than a sorting problem.  It's a single-machine scheduling problem with release dates.  Depending on what you are trying to do, the problem might be NP-Hard.  For example, if you are trying to mimimize the weighted-sum of the completion times (the weight being inversely proportional to the priority), the the problem is categorized as 1|ri;pmtn|Σ wiCi and is NP-hard.  There are numerous papers on this topic, but it might be more than what you need. In your case, you never want a solution with gaps, so what you might just need to do is a simple discrete-event simulation (  O(n log(n)) ) time.  You need to store released_jobs as a priority queue. unreleased_jobs = jobs  // sorted list of jobs, by release datereleased_jobs = {}      // priority queue of jobs, by priorityscheduled_jobs = {}     // simple listwhile (!unreleased_jobs.empty() || !released_jobs.empty()) {    while (unreleased_jobs.top().earliestTime  <= t) {        released_jobs.push(unreleased_jobs.pop())    }    if (!released_jobs.empty()) {       next_job = released_jobs.pop();       scheduled_jobs.push_back(next_job)       t = t + next_job.duration    } else {       // we have a gap       t = unreleased_jobs.top().earliestTime    }} One problem is that you might have a low-priority job with a release time just before a short, high-priority job, but it will produce a schedule with the property that there are no gaps (if a schedule with no gaps is possible).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/297035', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/11889/']}",jdg_158424

Question:
I can show the convergence of the following infinite product and some bounds for it: $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}=\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{2}} \sqrt[3]{1+\frac{1}{3}} \sqrt[4]{1+\frac{1}{4}} \cdots<$$ $$<\left(1+\frac{1}{4} \right)\left(1+\frac{1}{9} \right)\left(1+\frac{1}{16} \right)\cdots=\prod_{k \geq 2} \left(1+\frac{1}{k^2} \right)=\frac{\sinh \pi}{2 \pi}=1.83804$$ Here I used Euler's product for $\frac{\sin x}{x}$. The next upper bound is not as easy to evaluate, but still possible, taking two more terms in Taylor's series for $\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k} }$: $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}<\prod_{k \geq 2} \left(1+\frac{1}{k^2}-\frac{k-1}{2k^4}+\frac{2k^2-3k+1}{6k^6} \right)=$$ $$=\prod_{k \geq 2} \left(1+\frac{1}{k^2}-\frac{1}{2k^3}+\frac{5}{6k^4}-\frac{1}{2k^5}+\frac{1}{6k^6} \right)<$$ $$<\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{108}+\frac{\pi^6}{5670}-1-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2}-\frac{\zeta (5)}{2} \right)=1.81654$$ The numerical value of the infinite product is approximately: $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}=1.758743628$$ The ISC found no closed from for this number. Is there some way to evaluate this product or find better bounds in closed form? Edit Clement C suggested taking logarithm and it was a very useful suggestion, since I get the series: $$\ln \prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}= \frac{1}{2} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{2} \right)+\frac{1}{3} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{3} \right)+\dots$$ I don't know how to find the closed form, but I can certainly use it to find the boundaries (since the series for logarithm are very simple). $$\frac{1}{2} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{2} \right)+\frac{1}{3} \ln \left(1+\frac{1}{3} \right)+\dots>\sum^{\infty}_{k=2} \frac{1}{k^2}-\frac{1}{2}\sum^{\infty}_{k=2} \frac{1}{k^3}$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}>\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}-\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} \right)=1.72272$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}<\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}-\frac{5}{6}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} \right)=1.77065$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}>\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}-\frac{7}{12}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} -\frac{\zeta (5)}{4}\right)=1.75438$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}<\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}+\frac{\pi^6}{4725}-\frac{47}{60}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} -\frac{\zeta (5)}{4}\right)=1.76048$$ $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}>\exp \left( \frac{\pi^2}{6}+\frac{\pi^4}{270}+\frac{\pi^6}{4725}-\frac{37}{60}-\frac{\zeta (3)}{2} -\frac{\zeta (5)}{4} -\frac{\zeta (7)}{6}\right)=1.75803$$ This method generates much better bounds than my first idea. The last two are very good approximations. Edit 2 Actually, would it be correct to write (it gives the correct value of the product): $$\prod_{k \geq 2}\sqrt[k]{1+\frac{1}{k}}=\frac{1}{2} \exp \left( \sum_{k \geq 2} \frac{(-1)^k \zeta(k)}{k-1} \right)$$

","I don't know if a closed form exists, but to get geometric convergence, we can use the following. Since the product starts at $k=2$, we compute the sum$$\begin{align}\sum_{k=2}^\infty\frac1k\log\left(1+\frac1k\right)&=\sum_{k=2}^\infty\frac1k\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{nk^n}\\&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}n\sum_{k=2}^\infty\frac1{k^{n+1}}\\&=\sum_{n=1}^\infty(-1)^{n-1}\frac{\zeta(n+1)-1}{n}\\[6pt]&=0.564599706384424320592667709038\end{align}$$Note that $\frac{\zeta(n+1)-1}{n}\sim\frac1{n2^{n+1}}$.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Some of the reasons that would explain the limitations of using your built-in wifi adapter instead of a USB dongle on a pentesting focused vm: Monitor Mode support, or other features like this card that supports packet injection. It's easier to chose hardware if you have a wireless card that can be removed without having to teardown your computer/notebook. Allow the dongle to be accessed using usb-passthrough . Since a Virtual Machine is doomed to use the hypervisor infrastructure to create network cards, depending on how this is managed, could break monitor mode and other capabilities related to pentesting. This way, it will work like a card being plugged directly to the vm. This video is a good example on how to passthrough a USB card to a Kali Linux guest inside VirtualBox. Because those USB dongles have better plug-and-play support on Linux. You dont have to install drivers on Windows, since you will present this dongle using usb-passthrough. Here, you have a document that displays what are the best and more capable(with more features) USB devices for wireless monitoring. It's not only about the manufacturer, but the chip that matters most. Option to add external antenas through the dongle RP-TNC/SMA connector that are directional like the classic Cantenna or omni if you dont know where your target(s) is/are physically placed. PCI Passthrough, even not being a new topic, is still a pain to configure to be worth it(and it is a requirement to enable all pentesting related capabilities of the card - item2).

Question:
I am trying to use a combination of the C++ 11 direct data member initialisation and the ""using"" syntax to inherit the constructors of a base class. Now with gcc 5.4.0 (on Ubuntu 16.04) I observe a strange error, if the data member type has no default constructor. It is probably easiest to understand when looking on the following minimal example: #include <iostream>struct Foo {  Foo(int arg) { std::cout << ""Foo::Foo("" << arg << "")"" << std::endl; }};struct Base {  Base(int arg) { std::cout << ""Base::Base("" << arg << "")"" << std::endl; }};struct Derived : public Base {  using Base::Base;  Foo foo{42};};int main() {  Derived derived{120};} This code compiles and executes with the expected behaviour with clang. With gcc it does not compile, because the compiler deletes the constructor Derived::Derived(int) : ttt.cpp: In function ‘int main()’:ttt.cpp:17:22: error: use of deleted function ‘Derived::Derived(int)’   Derived derived{120};                      ^ttt.cpp:12:15: note: ‘Derived::Derived(int)’ is implicitly deleted because the default definition would be ill-formed:   using Base::Base;               ^ttt.cpp:12:15: error: no matching function for call to ‘Foo::Foo()’ttt.cpp:4:3: note: candidate: Foo::Foo(int)   Foo(int arg) { std::cout << ""Foo::Foo("" << arg << "")"" << std::endl; }   ^ttt.cpp:4:3: note:   candidate expects 1 argument, 0 providedttt.cpp:3:8: note: candidate: constexpr Foo::Foo(const Foo&) struct Foo {        ^ttt.cpp:3:8: note:   candidate expects 1 argument, 0 providedttt.cpp:3:8: note: candidate: constexpr Foo::Foo(Foo&&)ttt.cpp:3:8: note:   candidate expects 1 argument, 0 provided If I add a default constructor to Foo like this: Foo() { std::cout << ""Foo::Foo()"" << std::endl; }; also gcc can compile it. The code behaves exactly in the same way, in particular the added default constructor of Foo never gets executed. So my question is now, is this valid C++ 11? If yes, I probably have found a bug in gcc. Otherwise, shouldn't both gcc and clang give me an error message that this is not valid C++ 11? Edit after the question was nicely answered by @vlad-from-moscow: This bug seems to be present also in gcc 6.2, so I will file a bug report. 2nd edit: There already is a bug, which I didn't find in the first search: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=67054

There is written in the C++ Standard (12.9 Inheriting constructor) 8 An inheriting constructor for a class is implicitly deﬁned when it  is odr-used (3.2) to create an object of its class type (1.8). An  implicitly-deﬁned inheriting constructor performs the set of  initializations of the class that would be performed by a user-written  inline constructor for that class with a mem-initializer-list whose  only mem-initializer has a mem-initializer-id that names the base  class denoted in the nested-name-speciﬁer of the using-declaration and  an expression-list as speciﬁed below , and where the  compound-statement in its function body is empty (12.6.2). If that  user-written constructor would be ill-formed, the program is  ill-formed. Each expression in the expression-list is of the form  static_cast(p), where p is the name of the corresponding  constructor parameter and T is the declared type of p. Also according to the section (12.6.2 Initializing bases and members) 8 In a non-delegating constructor, if a given non-static data member  or base class is not designated by a mem-initializer-id (including the  case where there is no mem-initializer-list because the constructor  has noctor-initializer) and the entity is not a virtual base class of  an abstract class (10.4), then — if the entity is a non-static data member that has a  brace-or-equal-initializer, the entity is initialized as specified in  8.5;",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/40932844', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/5998125/']}",jdg_273418

","2017 — 2021 update Since 2009 when this question was asked, JavaScript has evolved significantly. All other answers are now obsolete or overly complicated. Here is the current best practice: function sleep(ms) {    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));} Or as a one-liner: await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000)); As a function: const sleep = ms => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, ms)); or in Typescript: const sleep = (ms: number) => new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, ms)); use it as: await sleep(<duration>); Demo: function sleep(ms) {    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));}async function demo() {    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {        console.log(`Waiting ${i} seconds...`);        await sleep(i * 1000);    }    console.log('Done');}demo(); Note that, await can only be executed in functions prefixed with the async keyword, or at the top level of your script in an increasing number of environments . await only pauses the current async function. This means it does not block the execution of the rest of the script, which is what you want in the vast majority of the cases. If you do want a blocking construct, see this answer using Atomics .wait , but note that most browsers will not allow it on the browser's main thread. Two new JavaScript features (as of 2017) helped write this ""sleep"" function: Promises, a native feature of ES2015 (aka ES6). We also use arrow functions in the definition of the sleep function. The async/await feature lets the code explicitly wait for a promise to settle (resolve or reject). Compatibility promises are supported in Node v0.12+ and widely supported in browsers , except IE async / await landed in V8 and has been enabled by default since Chrome 55 (released in Dec 2016) it landed in Node 7 in October 2016 and also landed in Firefox Nightly in November 2016 If for some reason you're using Node older than 7 (which reached end of life in 2017 ), or are targeting old browsers, async / await can still be used via Babel (a tool that will transpile JavaScript + new features into plain old JavaScript), with the transform-async-to-generator plugin.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 13, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/951030', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/115822/']}",jdg_92020

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","To start with, below is the SQL Order of Operations: FROM clause WHERE clause GROUP BY clause HAVING clause SELECT clause ORDER BY clause In a simple query, the filtering happens after the FROM clause ( joins are found on this part ). What your querty above does is it primarily joins the tables with their linking columns that defines their relationship. After the records has been set ( the result of joins ) the WHERE clause then takes place to filter out Type where is is equal to 1. Here's another example of using LEFT JOIN , First Query: SELECT  A.ID,        A.Name,        A.Type,        B.FirstName,        B.LastName,        B.DateOfBirthFROM    A        LEFT JOIN B             ON  A.ContactID = B.ID AND                B.LastName = 'Michaels' vs Second Query: SELECT  A.ID,        A.Name,        A.Type,        B.FirstName,        B.LastName,        B.DateOfBirthFROM    A        LEFT JOIN B ON  A.ContactID = B.IDWHERE   B.LastName = 'Michaels' The first query returns ALL the records from table A . What B.LastName = 'Michaels' does is before the table B will be join with table A , it filters out all the records where the LastName is equal to Michaels . So the records from table A which do not have matches on the filtered records on Table B will have NULL values on the columns from Table B . The second query will not yield the same result with the first query and performs exactly the same with INNER JOIN because after the records has been joined, another filtering will be executed on the result and takes only records where the LastName is equal to Michaels .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/15205676', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/283445/']}",jdg_139937

Question:
Surrounding the Impeachment trial of President Trump many news outlets have voiced that an acquittal will be setting precedent. Does this mean that subsequent presidents will be able to do the same things and cite precedent without fear of retribution? Is there any legal standing to setting precedent? Could President A set precedent with something and then President B could do the same thing and be impeached for doing that same exact thing? I'm a bit confused how setting precedent holds any legal value.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It should be noted, first of all, that impeachment is a political process and not a legal one.  This means that the precedent argument is not as strong as it would be in, for example, a Supreme Court case. In a legal case, a large part of a court's job is to interpret the meaning of a law.  When a court makes a determination of the meaning of a law, then other courts are expected to apply the same meaning of a law to maintain consistency across the legal system.  After all, if different courts apply the same law in different ways, it would become very confusing as to what a law actually means.  This is unless or until a higher court rejects this interpretation on appeal, or legislation is passed to invalidate such an interpretation. Meanwhile, one Congress cannot bind any of its successor Congresses.  They are under no obligation to look at precedent as they decide whether or not to impeach/convict.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/50003', 'https://politics.stackexchange.com', 'https://politics.stackexchange.com/users/30067/']}",jdg_375093

","Others have posted some good links on getting the Logging Application Block (LAB) working so I won't duplicate that here. In terms of formatting your exception you have 3 choices that I can think of: Use the default Exception.ToString() implementation (it's not bad) Write a Custom Formatter that integrates into the LAB. Write a helper function that performs the formatting and passes the string into the Write method. If option 1 doesn't meet your needs then I would recommend going with option 3 (since option 2 is overkill).

Question:
I have been developing enterprise applications for many years using .Net My apps usually have a domain model containing entities mapping to SQL DB tables.I use a Repository pattern, Dependency injection and a service layer. Recently we started working on MVC 3 projects and we had a debate where to put which logic.I came accross thin Controller / FAT Model architecture and was wondering how the service layer would fit in Option 1 - Model talks to services Controller is thin, calls methods on the models. The models ""know"" how to load themselfs from the DB and talk to repositories or services.E.g. customerModel has a Load(id) method and loads the customer and some child objects like GetContracts(). Option 2 - Controller talks to services Controller asks Services to retrieve model objects. The logic of loading / storing etc. Is in the service layer. The model is a pure entity model with data only. Why would option 1 be a better choice especially when we talk about enterprise applictions my experience tells me to separate concerns, keep models AND Controllers as thin as possible and have specialized services doing the Business logic (imcl. The DB interaction) Thanks for all advices and references to good resources.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","All of this depends on the intention and requirements of your application. That said, here's my suggestion for ""mid scale"" (not a local restaurant, and not Twitter/Facebook) web applications. Lean Domain Modeling Dry POCO style objects, preferably ignorant to the MVC architecture of your web application to remain as loosely coupled from your particular implementation as possible.perhaps even class library repack-able for use in an external application, say a REST API via a WCF Web Service). ""Model"" in MVC most accurately means the model the Controller is aware of and thus the the model intended for the View . In smaller (often Tutorial) applications the entity models of your ""Application/Domain Model Layer"" are often the same instantiated objects the controller ships off to a View. In larger applications developers often employ the tenets of MVVM architecture and begin using separate View Model objects. The controllers often call middle-tier services that work with the unseen entities below. In this scenario, the M in MVC most accurately means the View Model. Robust Service Layer This does not mean obese logic, but well-written single purpose services. While coding your business logic in services outside of the model is a bit more ""procedural"" than it is pure ""OOP"", it helps a lot with loose coupling, testing, and flexible deployment (ex. n-tier deployment). In my personal practice, I code services both down at the data layer, which I consider my behavioral modeling of the POCO objects (persistence mechanics, low level validation, etc.), and higher level services (business/workflow function) up closer to the MVC mechanics. Lean Controllers I make sure my controller is merely the coach , in that it is neither the play (services) or the player (entity model or view model), but simply decides who plays what position and what play to make. My controllers do two things: Call services that interact with the entity/domain Models Prepare a View Model for the appropriate View. Even authenticated/authorized controller actions are done via injected services/attributes. EDIT 1: Keep in mind, that this does not mean your Entity/Domain Model is or must be anemic. ORMs, repositories and factories, validation or state mechanics are welcome. It only means for applications of moderate scale, the Model in MVC represents the model meant for the controller, to hand off to your View . Hopefully this point will calm Fowler apostles who believe the anemic data model to be an anti-pattern . At the same time, it does reflect a slightly more procedural angle than OOP where it is more pure to include behavior in the modeled classes. There is no ""ultimate truth"", but using this pattern you'll find it easy to build, test, and deploy your applications - while maintaining a lot of re-usability and scalability. EDIT 2: That said, even for modestly sized applications, over architecting (that a word nerds made up?) a system is much too common. For instance, wrapping an ORM with a repository pattern, and then writing services to use the repository... all this is good for separation of concern and such, but if your project doesn't require (and is not very likely to soon require) such things, don't build it. There is nothing wrong with skipping the repository all together, writing thin business services (ex. query classes) against an ORM, or even having your controller talk directly to it. It all depends on scale. EDIT 3: I wanted to note that this explanation and advice is for the context of server-side MVC architecture like ASP.Net, not for clent-side frameworks like Knockout or Backbone.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/8735466', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/36546/']}",jdg_250492

I have a scrapy crawler which works fine.I now want to use its 'parse'  function to parse a given url.While there exists a command line utility to do so for a single url using command: scrapy parse <options> <url> But I want to do this inside my python code (and no starting a new process for every url is not an option) From what I figure what I need for this is essentially a way to create Response given a url.Since the response that scrapy takes is not the same as HTTPResponse, I am not sure how to get that response given a url. I did find a method make_reqests_from_url which does the obvious, but I am not sure how to get from scrapy Request to scrapy response, which I can pass to the parse function.

","I'm not a Java programmer, but I know a fair bit about rendering audio so hopefully the following might be of some help... Given that you will almost always have a much larger number of samples than available pixels the sensible thing to do would be to draw from a cached reduction or 'summary' of the sample data. This is typically how audio editors (such as Audacity ) render audio data. In fact the most common strategy is to compute the number of samples per pixel, then find the maximum and minimum samples for each block of size SamplesPerPixel , then draw a vertical line between each max-min pair. You might want to cache this reduction, or perhaps a series of such reductions for different zoom levels. Audacity caches to temporary files ('block files') on disk. The above is perhaps something of an oversimplification, however, because in reality you will want to compute the initial max-min pairs from a chunk of fixed size - say 256 samples - rather than from one of size SamplesPerPixel . Then you can compute further 'on the fly' reductions from that cached reduction. The point is that SamplesPerPixel will typically be a dynamic quantity - since the user might resize the canvas at any time (hope that makes sense...). Also remember that when you are drawing to your canvas you will need to scale the sample values by the width and height of the canvas. The best way to do this (in  the vertical direction, at least) is to normalize the samples, then multiply by the canvas height. 16-bit audio consists of samples in the range [-32768, 32767], so to normalize just do a floating-point division by 32768. Then reverse the sign (to flip the waveform to the canvas coordinates), add 1 (to compensate for the negative values) and multiply by half the canvas height. That's how I do it, anyway. This page shows how to build a rudimentary waveform display with Java Swing. I haven't looked at it in detail, but I think it just downsamples the data rather than computing max-min pairs. This will, of course, not provide as accurate a reduction as the max-min method, but it's easier to calculate. If you want to know how to do things properly you should dig into the Audacity source code (be warned, however - it's fairly gnarly C++). To get a general overview you might look at 'A Fast Data Structure for Disk-Based Audio Editing' , by the original author of Audacity, Dominic Mazzoni. You will need to purchase that from CMJ , however.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/12879216', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1549934/']}",jdg_119987

Is it possible to use Python to write cross-platform apps for both iOS and Android

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","For Android Google provides something called ASE (Android Scripting Environment) which allows scripting languages (Python included) to run on Android. More details here For iOS, it might be quite a bit more complicated (and I'd advise to check the latest version of iOS SDK agreement to check the current state of the law - apple tends to allow & disallow such apps periodically). For the technical part you might need to interface between Python & Objective C as well as do some wizardry to statically link all the libraries Python requires; full details are available here .Another approach for iOS Python development would be to embed a Python interpreter into you app and distribute your Python script with it (so to play nicely with Apple rules). In this case your Python application would be a Python interpreter which is packaged with your script and runs it automatically. Second option is to use Kivy framework(kivy.org) - it's a framework to write touch-friendly applications in Python and package them for different platforms. It's had Android support for a while, and recently added iOS support",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/10664196', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1404932/']}",jdg_309450

Question:
Is the sequence $a_{n}=\sin(n)$ uniformly distributed on the interval $[-1,1]$? For the first $10000$ $n$, it seems as if it is more dense at $-1$ and $1$ than in the middle. Is there any way to prove this or its uniform distribution? Also, can a result be generalized for $\sin^m(n)$ over its appropriate interval?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","By Weyl's equidistribution theorem, the sequence $\{e^{in}\}_{n\geq 1}$ is uniformly distributed over the unit circle, by the irrationality of $\pi$. The distribution of $\sin(n)$ over $(-1,1)$ is so the same as the distribution of $\sin(X)$, where $X$ is a random variable uniformly distributed over $(0,2\pi)$. The PDF of such distribution is so given by $\frac{1}{\pi\sqrt{1-t^2}}$, supported on $(-1,1)$.

There he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths."" For the LORD's teaching will go out from Zion; his word will go out from Jerusalem.

","Psalm 121 is an antiphonal pilgrim song 1 , apparently sung by a pilgrim group on the dangerous journey to Jerusalem, possibly just at the start of their journey. The dangers listed are: Attacks from animals or thieves in the mountains or not finding passage (verse 1) Falling or becoming lost (verse 3) Sunstroke by day, darkness by night (verse 6) These verses are sung alternately by the leader and the chorus. So in this Psalm, the mountains are a threatening presence that require an answer. The leaders starts by asking ""I look up at the mountains and ask from where will my help come?"", i.e. how will I cross these mountains? The chorus counters confidently "" My help will come from YHVH, maker of the heavens and the earth [and the mountains that you are afraid of]"", then the rest follows. If verse 1 were a statement rather than a question we would be stuck with two competing views of where the salvation comes from: ""the mountains"", not necessarily any particular mountain from God, maker of the mountains As if YHVH were a god of the mountains, as in I Kings 20:28 (NIV): The man of God came up and told the king of Israel, ""This is what the LORD says: 'Because the Arameans think the LORD is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys, I will deliver this vast army into your hands, and you will know that I am the LORD.'"" Regarding the Hebrew מֵאַיִן, ""from where"", it appears in the following verses: Genesis 29:4 (question) Genesis 42:7 (question) Numbers 11:13 (question) Joshua 2:4 (declarative form of question) ""I did not know from where did they come"" Judges 17:9 (question) II Kings 5:25 (question) II Kings 6:27 (rhetorical question) Nahum 3:7 (rhetorical question) Job 1:7 (question) Job 28:12 (question) Job 28:20 (question) We see from these examples that מאין, ""from where"" is always indicative of a question on the MT. Although Mount Zion, which is not mentioned at all in this psalm , a place of salvation, is on a mountain, it doesn't follow that mountains in general are a place of salvation or that all references to mountains in the OT are to Mount Zion. Compare Isaiah 40:4 (NIV) Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain. and Exodus 32:12: Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? http://www.scielo.org.za/pdf/ote/v23n3/02.pdf",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/44096', 'https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com', 'https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/users/20832/']}",jdg_212071

Question:
Assume I have an interface method implemented as public void DoSomething(User user) {    if (user.Gold > 1000) ChatManager.Send(user, ""You are rich: "" + user.Gold);} After some time I realize that I want to change it: public async Task DoSomething(User user) {    if (user.Gold > 1000) ChatManager.Send(user, ""You are rich: "" + user.Gold);    if (!user.HasReward)    {         using(var dbConnection = await DbPool.OpenConnectionAsync())         {             await dbConnection.Update(user, u =>                         {                            u.HasReward = true;                            u.Gold += 1000;                        });         }    }} I'm changing the method signature in the interface. But the calling methods were synchronous and I have to make not only them async but also the whole call tree async. Example: void A(){    _peer.SendResponse(""Ping: "" + _x.B());}double X.B(){    return _someCollection.Where(item => y.C(item)).Average();}bool Y.C(int item){   // ...   _z.DoSomething();   return _state.IsCorrect;} should be changed to async void AAsync(){    _peer.SendResponse(""Ping: "" + await _x.BAsync());}async Task<double> X.BAsync(){    // await thing breaks LINQ!    var els = new List<int>();    foreach (var el in _someCollection)    {        if (await y.CAsync(item)) els.Add(el);    }    return _els.Average();}async Task<bool> Y.CAsync(int item){   // ...   await _z.DoSomething();   return _state.IsCorrect;} The affected call tree may be very big (many systems and interfaces) so this change is hard to do. Also when the first A method is called from interface method like IDisposable.Dispose - I can't make it async. Another example: imagine that multiple calls to A were stored as delegates. Previously they were just called with _combinedDelegate.Invoke() but now I should go through GetInvocationList() and await on each item. Oh, and consider also replacing property getter with async method. I can't use Task.Wait() or .Result because: It's wasting ThreadPool threads in server app It leads to deadlocks: if all ThreadPool threads are Wait ing there are no threads to complete any task. So the question is: should I make absolutely all my methods initially async even if I'm not planning to call anything async inside? Won't it hurt performance? Or how to design things to avoid such hard refactorings?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","should I make absolutely all my methods initially async even if I'm not planning to call anything async inside? This design problem with async is essentially the same as the problem with IDisposable . That is, interfaces have to predict their implementations. And this is going to be messy, no matter what you do. In my experience, it's usually rather straightforward to consider a method/interface/class and predict whether it will use I/O or not. If it requires I/O, then it should probably be made task-returning. Sometimes (but not always), it's possible to structure your code so that I/O is done in its own section of the code, leaving business objects and logic strictly synchronous. The Redux pattern in the JavaScript world is a good example of this. But bottom line, sometimes you make the wrong call and have to refactor. I think this is a far better approach than just making every method asynchronous. Do you make every interface inherit from IDisposable and use using everywhere? Nah, you only add it when necessary; and you should take the same approach with async .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/39321306', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1619238/']}",jdg_239677

Question:
I am attempting to draw a nice MKPolyline on an MKPolylineView . Everything is going great so far - the polyline draws just as I want it to and when I want it to using the following code: [[self map] addOverlay:routeLine]; And this method to tell the app how to draw it: - (MKOverlayView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForOverlay:(id <MKOverlay>)overlay {    MKOverlayView* overlayView = nil;    self.routeLineView = [[MKPolylineView alloc] initWithPolyline:[self routeLine]];    [[self routeLineView] setFillColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:167/255.0f green:210/255.0f blue:244/255.0f alpha:1.0]];    [[self routeLineView] setStrokeColor:[UIColor colorWithRed:0/255.0f green:136/255.0f blue:255/255.0f alpha:1.0]];    [[self routeLineView] setLineWidth:15.0];    [[self routeLineView] setLineCap:kCGLineCapRound];    overlayView = [self routeLineView];    return overlayView;} As a result I get a line with a solid blue. The blue I see is not however the fill color with the stroke I am expecting - it is the blue of the stroke color. There is no fill color when I use this method. Why doesn't it draw the fill color on the polyline? After investigating further, I found this tidbit of information in the Quick Help section of Xcode: The MKPolylineView class provides the visual representation for an MKPolyline annotation object. This view strokes the path represented by the annotation. ( This class does not fill the area enclosed by the path .) You can change the color and other drawing attributes of the path by modifying the properties inherited from the MKOverlayPathView class. That just sounds ridiculous. I have to use this class to set the fill color, but I can't use this class to draw the fill color? That just seems very odd considering it already draws the stroke. The last line in this explanation from the documentation is a little unclear but seems to provide an answer - I'm just having a hard time coding / finding the answer. I don't have an MKOverlayPathView in my project (what is that anyway?) but it seems to be the solution - does anyone know how to use it?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","If you want a line of one color, and a fill of another, use a MKPolygon instead of a MKPolyline . So modify your original creation of the annotation accordingly. And then you modify your viewForOverlay (or, for iOS 7, rendererForOverlay ) to recognize the MKPolygon and do something like the following: // for iOS7+; see `viewForOverlay` for earlier versions- (MKOverlayRenderer *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView rendererForOverlay:(id<MKOverlay>)overlay{    if ([overlay isKindOfClass:[MKPolygon class]])    {        MKPolygonRenderer *renderer = [[MKPolygonRenderer alloc] initWithPolygon:overlay];        renderer.fillColor   = [[UIColor cyanColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2];        renderer.strokeColor = [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.7];        renderer.lineWidth   = 3;        return renderer;    }    return nil;}// for iOS versions prior to 7; see `rendererForOverlay` for iOS7 and later- (MKOverlayView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForOverlay:(id <MKOverlay>)overlay{    if ([overlay isKindOfClass:[MKPolygon class]])    {        MKPolygonView *overlayView = [[MKPolygonView alloc] initWithPolygon:overlay];        overlayView.fillColor      = [[UIColor cyanColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2];        overlayView.strokeColor    = [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.7];        overlayView.lineWidth      = 3;        return overlayView;    }    return nil;} Note, you don't need to reference any of your class properties here, as the overlay is passed to your viewForOverlay . This is a little more flexible in case you ever have multiple overlays added to your map. Incidentally, these are my standard viewForOverlay (iOS versions prior to 7.0) and rendererForOverlay (iOS 7+), which will handle MKPolygon , MKPolyline , and MKCircle overlays: // for iOS7+; see `viewForOverlay` for earlier versions- (MKOverlayRenderer *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView rendererForOverlay:(id<MKOverlay>)overlay{    if ([overlay isKindOfClass:[MKPolygon class]])    {        MKPolygonRenderer *renderer = [[MKPolygonRenderer alloc] initWithPolygon:overlay];        renderer.fillColor   = [[UIColor cyanColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2];        renderer.strokeColor = [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.7];        renderer.lineWidth   = 3;        return renderer;    }    if ([overlay isKindOfClass:[MKCircle class]])    {        MKCircleRenderer *renderer = [[MKCircleRenderer alloc] initWithCircle:overlay];        renderer.fillColor   = [[UIColor cyanColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2];        renderer.strokeColor = [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.7];        renderer.lineWidth   = 3;        return renderer;    }    if ([overlay isKindOfClass:[MKPolyline class]])    {        MKPolylineRenderer *renderer = [[MKPolylineRenderer alloc] initWithPolyline:overlay];        renderer.strokeColor = [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.7];        renderer.lineWidth   = 3;        return renderer;    }    return nil;}// for iOS versions prior to 7; see `rendererForOverlay` for iOS7 and later- (MKOverlayView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForOverlay:(id <MKOverlay>)overlay{    if ([overlay isKindOfClass:[MKPolygon class]])    {        MKPolygonView *overlayView = [[MKPolygonView alloc] initWithPolygon:overlay];        overlayView.fillColor      = [[UIColor cyanColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2];        overlayView.strokeColor    = [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.7];        overlayView.lineWidth      = 3;        return overlayView;    }    if ([overlay isKindOfClass:[MKCircle class]])    {        MKCircleView *overlayView = [[MKCircleView alloc] initWithCircle:overlay];        overlayView.fillColor     = [[UIColor cyanColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.2];        overlayView.strokeColor   = [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.7];        overlayView.lineWidth     = 3;        return overlayView;    }    if ([overlay isKindOfClass:[MKPolyline class]])    {        MKPolylineView *overlayView = [[MKPolylineView alloc] initWithPolyline:overlay];        overlayView.strokeColor     = [[UIColor blueColor] colorWithAlphaComponent:0.7];        overlayView.lineWidth       = 3;        return overlayView;    }    return nil;} This way I can add as many of these three types of overlays to my map, and it can render all of them properly.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/14915226', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/814730/']}",jdg_194103

Question:
Old question My understanding is that C# has in some sense HashSet and set types. I understand what HashSet is. But why set is a separate word? Why not every set is HashSet<Object> ? New question Why does C# has no generic Set type, similar to Dictionary type? From my point of view, I would like to have a set with standard lookup/addition/deletion performance. I wouldn't care much whether it is realized with hashes or something else. So why not make a set class that would actually be implemented as a HashSet in this version of C# but perhaps somewhat different in a future version? Or why not at least interface ISet ? Answer Learned thanks to everyone who answered below: ICollection implements a lot of what you'd expect from ISet . From my point of view, though, ICollection implements IEnumerable while sets don't have to be enumerable --- example: set of real numbers between 1 and 2 (even more, sets can be generated dynamically). I agree this is a minor rant, as 'normal programmers' rarely need uncountable sets. Ok, I think I get it. HashSet was absolutely meant to be called Set but the word Set is reserved in some sense. More specifically, creators of .NET architecture wanted to have a consistent set (sic!) of classes for different languages. This means that every name of the standard class must not coincide with any keyword in the .NET languages. The word Set , however, is used in VB.NET which is actually case-insensitive (is it?) so unfortunately there is no room for maneuvre there. Mystery solved :) Epilogue The new answer by Alex Y. links to the MSDN page which describes  the upcoming .NET 4.0 interface ISet which behaves pretty much as I thought it should and is implemented by HashedSet . Happy end.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","(Your original question about set has been answered. IIRC, ""set"" is the word with the most different meanings in the English language... obviously this has an impact in computing too.) I think it's fine to have HashSet<T> with that name, but I'd certainly welcome an ISet<T> interface. Given that HashSet<T> only arrived in .NET 3.5 (which in itself was surprising) I suspect we may eventually get a more complete collection of set-based types. In particular, the equivalent of Java's LinkedHashSet , which maintains insertion order, would be useful in some cases. To be fair, the ICollection<T> interface actually covers most of what you'd want in ISet<T> , so maybe that isn't required. However, you could argue that the core purpose of a set (which is mostly about containment, and only tangentially about being able to iterate over the elements) isn't quite the same as a collection. It's tricky. In fact, a truly mathematical set may not be iterable or countable - for instance, you could have ""the set of real numbers between 1 and 2."" If you had an arbitrary-precision numeric type, the count would be infinite and iterating over it wouldn't make any sense. Likewise the idea of ""adding"" to a set doesn't always make sense. Mutability is a tricky business when naming collections :( EDIT: Okay, responding to the comment: the keyword set is in no way a legacy to do with Visual Basic. It's the operation which sets the value of a property, vs get which retrieves the operation. This has nothing to do with the idea of a set as an operation. Imagine that instead the keywords were actually fetch and assign , e.g. // Not real code!public int Foo{    fetch    {        return fooField;    }     assign    {        fooField = value;    } } Is the purpose clear there? Now the real equivalent of that in C# is just public int Foo{    get    {        return fooField;    }     set    {        fooField = value;    } } So if you write: x = y.Foo; that will use the get part of the property. If you write: y.Foo = x; that will use the set part. Is that any clearer?",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/1023697', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/115200/']}",jdg_167429

Question:
I'm currently trying to read small video files sent from a server In order to read a file using libavformat, you are supposed to call av_open_input_file(&avFormatContext, ""C:\\path\\to\\video.avi"", 0, 0, 0); The problem is that in this case the file is not on the disk, but in memory. What I'm doing for the moment is downloading the file, writing it on the disk using a temporary name, and then calling av_open_input_file with the temporary file name, which is not a very clean solution. In fact what I want is a function like av_open_custom(&avFormatContext, &myReadFunction, &mySeekFunction); but I didn't find any in the documentation.I guess it is technically possible, since the name of the file is not something that helps the library determine which format it is using. So is there a function like this, or an alternative to av_open_input_file?

","It's funny how I always find the solution by myself right after I post the question on this site, even though I've been working on this problem for hours.

","My guess is that the following happens: You have a 32 bit process running in the WOW64 emulator under 64 bit Windows. You attempt to start a new process named mstsc.exe . The system searches on the path for that and finds it in the system directory. Because you run under WOW64, the system directory is the 32 bit system directory, SysWOW64. The process starts and immediately detects that it is a 32 bit process running under WOW64 under a 64 bit system. The 32 bit mstsc.exe then determines that it needs to start the 64 bit version of mstsc.exe , which it does, passing on any command line arguments, and then immediately terminates. This would explain why your new process immediately terminates. Some possible solutions: Disable file system redirection before you start the new process. Obviously you should re-enable it immediately afterwards. Create a small 64 bit program that lives in the same directory as your executable, whose sole job is to launch programs. You can start this process and ask it to launch the other process. That would allow you to escape from the clutches of the emulator and its redirection.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/23814441', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3666292/']}",jdg_282944

","Core issue 2313 changed the standard so that structured bindings are never names of variables, making them never capturable. P0588R1 's reformulation of lambda capture wording makes this prohibition explicit: If a lambda-expression [...] captures a structured binding (explicitly  or implicitly), the program is ill-formed. Note that this wording is supposedly a placeholder while the committee figures out exactly how such captures should work. Previous answer kept for historical reasons: This technically should compile, but there's a bug in the standard here. The standard says that lambdas can only capture variables. And it says that a non-tuple-like structured binding declaration doesn't introduce variables. It introduces names, but those names aren't names of variables. A tuple-like structured binding declaration, on the other hand, does introduce variables. a and b in auto [a, b] = std::make_tuple(1, 2); are actual reference-typed variables. So they can be captured by a lambda. Obviously this is not a sane state of affairs, and the committee knows this, so a fix should be forthcoming (though there appears be some disagreement over exactly how capturing a structured binding should work).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/46114214', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2836552/']}",jdg_342859

","If you tried the same thing with pointers, as in boost::is_same<int const *, boost::add_const<int *>::type>::value you'd discover that it is also false, since boost::add_const<int *>::type generates int *const type, which is obviously not the same as int const * . Essentially the same thing happens with references, i.e. boost::add_const<int &>::type is an attempt to generate int &const . Formally, type int &const is illegal in C++ - cv-qualification cannot be applied to the reference itself.

Question:
Why  $[\mathbb Q( \omega, 2^{1/3}) : \mathbb Q]$ =6 ?, We know that the dimension of $\mathbb Q(\omega,2^{1/3})$ over $\mathbb Q$ will be equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial which has roots $\omega, 2^{1/3}$ . Now $(x^2+x+1)(x^3-2)$ which has roots $\omega, 2^{1/3}$  so I thought the dimension should be 5. But in the computation $[\mathbb Q(\omega,2^{1/3}):\mathbb Q]=[\mathbb Q(\omega,2^{1/3}):\mathbb Q(\omega)][\mathbb Q(\omega): \mathbb Q] =6$. Where am I wrong ? Please someone check.. Thank you.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The ""dimension is equal to the degree of the minimal polynomial"" thing only works when you have a single element that generates the whole extension. Take, for instance, $\alpha = \omega + 2^{1/3}$. It has minimal polynomial$$x^6 - 3 x^5 + 6 x^4 - 11 x^3 + 12 x^2 + 3 x + 1$$over $\Bbb Q$ and therefore generates an extension of degree $6$. Clearly $\Bbb Q(\alpha)\subseteq \Bbb Q(\omega, 2^{1/3})$, so the degree of $Q(\omega, 2^{1/3})$ cannot be $5$. Using this, and the multiplicative formula for the extension degrees which you've already used in your question, we can see that if you have several distinct elements that generate a field extension, we multiply the degrees of their respective minimal polynomials instead of adding them. Or... almost. We multiply the degree of the minimal polynomial of $\omega$ over $\Bbb Q$ with the degree of the minimal polynomial of $2^{1/3}$ over $\Bbb Q(\omega)$ (or vice versa). It might not make a difference in this case, but it is important with other extensions like $\Bbb Q(\sqrt2, \sqrt[4]2+\sqrt2)$, and many other, probably less trivial examples.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2386608', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/365615/']}",jdg_113946

I am trying to implement buddhabrot fractal . I can't understand one thing: all implementations I inspected pick random points on the image to calculate the path of the particle escaping. Why do they do this? Why not go over all pixels? What purpose do the random points serve? More points make better pictures so I think going over all pixels makes the best picture - am I wrong here? From my test data: Working on 400x400 picture. So 160 000 pixels to iterate if i go all over. Using random sampling,Picture only starts to take shape after 1 million points. Good results show up around 1 billion random points which takes hours to compute.

","Random sampling is better than grid sampling for two main reasons. First because grid sampling will introduce grid-like artifacts in the resulting image. Second is because grid sampling may not give you enough samples for a converged resulting image. If after completing a grid pass, you wanted more samples, you would need to make another pass with a slightly offset grid (so as not to resample the same points) or switch to a finer grid which may end up doing more work than is needed. Random sampling gives very smooth results and you can stop the process as soon as the image has converged or you are satisfied with the results.

Question:
I have carried out a principal components analysis of six variables $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ and $F$. If I understand correctly, unrotated PC1 tells me what linear combination of these variables describes/explains the most variance in the data and PC2 tells me what linear combination of these variables describes the next most variance in the data and so on. I'm just curious -- is there any way of doing this ""backwards""? Let's say I choose some linear combination of these variables -- e.g. $A+2B+5C$, could I work out how much variance in the data this describes?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","If we start with the premise that all variables have been centred (standard practice in PCA), then the total variance in the data is just the sum of squares: $$T=\sum_{i}(A_{i}^{2}+B_{i}^{2}+C_{i}^{2}+D_{i}^{2}+E_{i}^{2}+F_{i}^{2})$$ This is equal to the trace of the covariance matrix of the variables, which equals the sum of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.  This is the same quantity that PCA speaks of in terms of ""explaining the data"" - i.e. you want your PCs to explain the greatest proportion of the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix.  Now if we make this an objective function for a set of predicted values like so: $$S=\sum_{i}\left(\left[A_{i}-\hat{A}_{i}\right]^{2}+\dots+\left[F_{i}-\hat{F}_{i}\right]^{2}\right)$$ Then the first principal component minimises $S$ among all rank 1 fitted values $(\hat{A}_{i},\dots,\hat{F}_{i})$.  So it would seem like the appropriate quantity you are after is $$P=1-\frac{S}{T}$$To use your example $A+2B+5C$, we need to turn this equation into rank 1 predictions.  First you need to normalise the weights to have sum of squares 1.  So we replace $(1,2,5,0,0,0)$ (sum of squares $30$) with $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{30}},\frac{2}{\sqrt{30}},\frac{5}{\sqrt{30}},0,0,0\right)$.  Next we ""score"" each observation according to the normalised weights: $$Z_{i}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{30}}A_{i}+\frac{2}{\sqrt{30}}B_{i}+\frac{5}{\sqrt{30}}C_{i}$$ Then we multiply the scores by the weight vector to get our rank 1 prediction. $$\begin{pmatrix}\hat{A}_{i} \\\hat{B}_{i} \\\hat{C}_{i} \\\hat{D}_{i} \\\hat{E}_{i} \\\hat{F}_{i}\end{pmatrix}=Z_{i}\times\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{30}} \\\frac{2}{\sqrt{30}} \\\frac{5}{\sqrt{30}} \\0 \\0 \\0\end{pmatrix}$$ Then we plug these estimates into $S$ calculate $P$.  You can also put this into matrix norm notation, which may suggest a different generalisation.  If we set $O$ as the $N\times q$ matrix of observed values of the variables ($q=6$ in your case), and $E$ as a corresponding matrix of predictions.  We can define the proportion of variance explained  as: $$\frac{||O||_{2}^{2}-||O-E||_{2}^{2}}{||O||_{2}^{2}}$$ Where $||.||_{2}$ is the Frobenius matrix norm .  So you could ""generalise"" this to be some other kind of matrix norm, and you will get a difference measure of ""variation explained"", although it won't be ""variance"" per se unless it is sum of squares.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/8630', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/3845/']}",jdg_220926

Question:
Hamiltonian is related to Lagrangian with the equation: $$H= p\dot{q}- L(q,\dot{q},t) $$ Now, $H$ is function of $p,q,t$ so the Hamiltonian to be unique, $\dot{q}$ must be expressed uniquely using $p,q,t$ . But is there always a one to one mapping between $p$ and $\dot{q}$ ? How to prove that?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","In general, the mapping defined by $$ p_i(q,\dot{q}) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}^i}$$ is neither injective nor surjective. Theories in which it is not are constrained Hamiltonian theories and equivalently Lagrangian gauge theories in which the solutions to the equations of motion contain arbitrary functions of time. ""Constrained"" means that the $q$ and $p$ are not independent after the transformation and that there are primary constraints $\phi_i(q,p) = 0$ among them that hold off-shell. The map is (locally) invertible if and only if $$ \mathrm{det}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}^i \partial \dot{q}^j}\right) \neq 0$$ for all $(q,\dot{q})$ . In the Lagrangian world this can be seen because the accelerations $\ddot{q}^i$ are determined uniquely by pairs $(q,\dot{q})$ if and only if this is true, otherwise we have gauge degrees of freedom because $$ \ddot{q}^j\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}^i \partial \dot{q}^j} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q^i} - \dot{q}^j\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}^i \partial q^j},$$ which follows from the Euler-Lagrange equations, can be solved for $\ddot{q}$ uniquely only if $\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}^i \partial \dot{q}^j}$ is invertible. When there are constraints, the Hamiltonian $$ H = \dot{q}^i p_i - L$$ is not unique in the sense that it is uniquely determined only on the physically relevant constraint surface in phase space defined by the $\phi_i(q,p) = 0$ . The transformation $$ H \mapsto H + \phi_i(q,p)f^i(q,p)$$ for arbitrary functions $f^i$ leaves the physics unchanged since the additional term vanishes off-shell on the constraint surface. Hence the Hamiltonian associated with a Lagrangian with gauge freedom is not unique.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/546495', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/179979/']}",jdg_254230

Question:
I am looking to build a custom keyboard and bring it to work, but the security department is extremely wary of keyloggers, and rightly so. Now, my understanding of hardware keyloggers is that they are either USB adapters or additional PCBs wired into keyboards, and since I am not planning on wiring a keylogger into my own keyboard I feel as though I should be safe. However, the keyboard PCB I have is from some lesser-known Chinese distributor, so I am now concerned that the PCB itself may contain keylogging software. Is this possible, or is a secondary PCB required for keylogging capabilities?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The answer that you don't really want is that keyloggers can be very stealthily incorporated into pretty much anything: Keyboard with integrated keylogger: https://www.paraben-sticks.com/keyboard-keylogger.html Less savoury keylogger found in retail keyboard, sending keystrokes back: https://thehackernews.com/2017/11/mantistek-keyboard-keylogger.html Wifi keylogger in a USB extension cord: https://www.amazon.co.uk/AirDrive-Forensic-Keylogger-Cable-Pro/dp/B07DCCBBHT QMK the firmware used on many handmade keyboards is fully programmable. Many keyboards use quite sophisticated CPUs (QMK supports e.g. Atmel AVR and ARM processors) . Adding an sdcard to a mainboard is quite easy. All of this is fairly irrelevant, because you're approaching the issue from the wrong direction: since I am not planning on wiring a keylogger into my own keyboard I  feel as though I should be safe This is assuming that the threat model that IT Security are working with are you being an unassuming victim to something like the second link. The more probable route is assuming that you are a potentially malicious insider, and aiming to use a stealthed keylogger, coupled with standard business practices (""Hey, {Admin}, I need this totally legitimate software, can you just enter your credentials to install it?""). While the first option is something to protect from, the second may also be considered. Luckily for the IT Security team, the solution is simple, known and approved keyboards are the only ones to be used.

Question:
There's the following bit of Python code in a project I have to maintain: # If the `factor` decimal is given, compute new price and a deltafactor = +factor.quantize(TWOPLACES)new_price = +Decimal(old_price * factor).quantize(TWOPLACES)delta = new_price - old_price The question here is the purpose of + in front of a variable. Python docs call it unary plus operator , which “yields its numeric argument unchanged”. Can it be safely removed then? (Incidentally, the code was written by me some time ago, hopefully I've learned the lesson—it wouldn't be a question if tests existed, or if the use of unary plus on a decimal was clarified in comments.)

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","What that plus sign does depends on what it's defined to do by the result of that expression (that object's __pos__() method is called). In this case, it's a Decimal object, and the unary plus is equivalent to calling the plus() method. Basically, it's used to apply the current context (precision, rounding, etc.) without changing the sign of the number. Look for a setcontext() or localcontext() call elsewhere to see what the context is. For more information, see here . The unary plus is not used very often, so it's not surprising this usage is unfamiliar. I think the decimal module is the only standard module that uses it.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/10748185', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/247441/']}",jdg_201090

Question:
I'm trying to understand memory fences in c++11, I know there are better ways to do this, atomic variables and so on,  but wondered if this usage was correct. I realize that this program doesn't do anything useful, I just wanted to make sure that the usage of the fence functions did what I thought they did. Basically that the release ensures that any changes made in this thread before the fence are visible to other threads after the fence, and that in the second thread that any changes to the variables are visible in the thread immediately after the fence? Is my understanding correct? Or have I missed the point entirely? #include <iostream>#include <atomic>#include <thread>int a;void func1(){    for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i)    {        a = i;        // Ensure that changes to a to this point are visible to other threads        atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);    }}void func2(){    for(int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i)    {        // Ensure that this thread's view of a is up to date        atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);        std::cout << a;    }}int main(){    std::thread t1 (func1);    std::thread t2 (func2);    t1.join(); t2.join();}

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Your usage does not actually ensure the things you mention in your comments. That is, your usage of fences does not ensure that your assignments to a are visible to other threads or that the value you read from a is 'up to date.' This is because, although you seem to have the basic idea of where fences should be used, your code does not actually meet the exact requirements for those fences to ""synchronize"". Here's a different example that I think demonstrates correct usage better. #include <iostream>#include <atomic>#include <thread>std::atomic<bool> flag(false);int a;void func1(){    a = 100;    atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);    flag.store(true, std::memory_order_relaxed);}void func2(){    while(!flag.load(std::memory_order_relaxed))        ;    atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);    std::cout << a << '\n'; // guaranteed to print 100}int main(){    std::thread t1 (func1);    std::thread t2 (func2);    t1.join(); t2.join();} The load and store on the atomic flag do not synchronize, because they both use the relaxed memory ordering. Without the fences this code would be a data race, because we're performing conflicting operations a non-atomic object in different threads, and without the fences and the synchronization they provide there would be no happens-before relationship between the conflicting operations on a . However with the fences we do get synchronization because we've guaranteed that thread 2 will read the flag written by thread 1 (because we loop until we see that value), and since the atomic write happened after the release fence and the atomic read happens-before the acquire fence, the fences synchronize. (see § 29.8/2 for the specific requirements.) This synchronization means anything that happens-before the release fence happens-before anything that happens-after the acquire fence. Therefore the non-atomic write to a happens-before the non-atomic read of a . Things get trickier when you're writing a variable in a loop, because you might establish a happens-before relation for some particular iteration, but not other iterations, causing a data race. std::atomic<int> f(0);int a;void func1(){    for (int i = 0; i<1000000; ++i) {        a = i;        atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release);        f.store(i, std::memory_order_relaxed);    }}void func2(){    int prev_value = 0;    while (prev_value < 1000000) {        while (true) {            int new_val = f.load(std::memory_order_relaxed);            if (prev_val < new_val) {                prev_val = new_val;                break;            }        }        atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire);        std::cout << a << '\n';    }} This code still causes the fences to synchronize but does not eliminate data races. For example if f.load() happens to return 10 then we know that a=1 , a=2 , ... a=10 have all happened-before that particular cout<<a , but we don't know that cout<<a happens-before a=11 . Those are conflicting operations on different threads with no happens-before relation; a data race.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/13632344', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/417292/']}",jdg_171751

After running the first mile he'll have 5 balls. After running the second mile, he'll have 2 balls. After running the third mile, he'll have 1 ball. After running the fourth mile, he'll have 0 balls.

Question:
I am using Spring Cache, where I pass in a collection of keys, and the return is a list of entities. I would like to have the caching framework understand that each element in the return list is to be cached with the corresponding code. At the moment, it seems that the key is the whole list, and if I am missing a key in the subsequent call, it'll try to reload the whole collection again. @Override@Cacheable(value = ""countries"")public List<Country> getAll(List<String>codes) {    return countryDao.findAllInCodes(codes);} another possibility is that the return is a map, similarly I would like the cache to be intelligent enough to only query for items that were never queried before, also to cache them each item with its key. @Override@Cacheable(value = ""countries"")public Map<String,Country> getAllByCode(List<String>codes) {    return countryDao.findAllInCodes(codes);} Suppose the country class looks like this: class Country{  String code;   String fullName;  long id;... // getters setters constructurs etc.. } Is this possible with Spring Cache?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","In fact, it is possible, even with Spring's Caching Abstraction , but not out-of-the-box (OOTB).  Essentially, you must customize Spring's caching infrastructure (Explained further below) By default , Spring's caching infrastructure uses the entire @Cacheable method parameter arguments as the cache ""key"", as explained here .  Of course you can also customize the key resolution using either a SpEL Expression or with a custom KeyGenerator implementation, as explained here . Still, that does not break up the collection or array of parameter arguments along with the @Cacheable method's return value into individual cache entries (i.e. key/value pairs based on the array/collection or Map). For that, you need a custom implementation of Spring's CacheManager (dependent on your caching strategy/provider) and Cache interfaces. NOTE: Ironically, this will be the 3rd time I have answered nearly the same question, first here , then here and now here , :-).  Anyway... I have updated/cleaned up my example (a bit) for this posting. Notice that my example extends and customizes the ConcurrentMapCacheManager provided in the Spring Framework itself. Theoretically, you could extend/customize any CacheManager implementation, like Redis's in Spring Data Redis , here ( source ), or Pivotal GemFire's CacheManager in Spring Data GemFire , here ( source ).  The open source version of Pivotal GemFire is Apache Geode , which has a corresponding Spring Data Geode project, ( source for CacheManager in Spring Data Geode , which is basically identical to SD GemFire).  Of course, you can apply this technique to other caching providers... Hazelcast, Ehcache, etc. However, the real guts of the work is handled by the custom implementation (or mores specifically, the base class ) of Spring's Cache interface. Anyway, hopefully from my example , you will be able to figure out what you need to do in your application to satisfy your application's caching requirements. Additionally, you can apply the same approach to handling Maps , but I will leave that as an exercise for you, ;-). Hope this helps!

Question:
I have an problem, which at first thoughts (and being new to Arduino) I though was a perfect application for an Arduino. However, after trying and failing to implement it I am doubting myself! Simply - I need to control many LEDs independently, many of which will have their own individual patterns - for example ""5 seconds on - 5 seconds off"". ""continuous flashes"" - or sequences such as ""2 flashes, pause, 1 flash"". Obviously without the luxury of threads I am becoming a little unstuck. Be great to hear if a) Arduino is the best choice and b) if it is - how can I go about this! Thanks in advance :)

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Handling multiple patterns at the same time is certainly possible with a platform like Arduino, and there are a number of ways you could go about it. One method I would consider is writing functions which effectively represent each pattern mathematically. You'd just pass it the total time that's elapsed in your program so far, and it will do the appropriate action for that specific moment in time. It will return immediately afterwards (no delays or anything). To do that, you'll first need to know how long a single cycle of the pattern lasts. You can then use the modulo operator to figure out how far through the current cycle you are. From there, all you need to do is have some if conditions to determine what to do at any given time. Here's what it might look like for your ""5 seconds on, 5 seconds off"" pattern: function pattern5on5off(unsigned long totalTime){  // Calculate how far through the current cycle we are  const unsigned long cycleTime = totalTime % 10000;  // If we're in the first 5 seconds of the cycle then turn the light on.  // Otherwise, turn it off.  if (cycleTime < 5000)    digitalWrite(3, HIGH);  else    digitalWrite(3, LOW);} Admittedly, constantly calling digitalWrite() when you don't technically need to isn't very efficient. It shouldn't cause any harm though, and is fairly easy to optimise if necessary. To use the above example in a sketch, you'd just need to call it in loop() , and pass the number you get from millis() ; e.g.: void loop(){  const unsigned long totalTime = millis();  pattern5on5off(totalTime);  // call other patterns here...} Other patterns will be more complex, but follow the same principle. You'd just to use appropriate if statements to express your logic. The vital thing to remember is that the function represents a specific moment in time. It should never pause or delay the program, otherwise it will prevent the other patterns from running. Edit: Timing on the first cycle As jfpoilpret noted in the comments, the very first cycle will start at a random point. This is because the first time you call millis() in loop() , it won't start at 0 (the device will already have been running for a short time before loop() gets called). It's easy to resolve though, if necessary. You would do it by offsetting the totalTime value by the whatever value you got on the very first time around loop() . For example: unsigned long g_startTime = 0;void loop(){  unsigned long totalTime = 0;  if (g_startTime == 0) {    // This is the first cycle.    // Store the start time so we can compensate later.    g_startTime = millis();  } else {    // This is not the first cycle.    // Compensate for the start time.    totalTime = millis() - g_startTime;  }  pattern5on5off(totalTime);  // etc..}",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/3248', 'https://arduino.stackexchange.com', 'https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/3116/']}",jdg_279678

Question:
List<User> list = LoadUsers();JObject json = new JObject();json[""users""] = new JValue(list); Doesn't seem to be working? Error: Could not determine JSON object type for type System.Collections.Generic.List`1

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","A JValue can only contain simple values like strings, ints, booleans, dates and the like.  It cannot contain a complex object.  I suspect what you really want is this: List<User> list = LoadUsers();JObject json = new JObject();json[""users""] = JToken.FromObject(list); The above will convert the list of User objects into a JArray of JObjects representing the users, then assign that to the users property on the new JObject .  You can confirm this by examining the Type property of json[""users""] and see that it is Array . In contrast, if you do json[""users""] = new JValue(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(list)) as was suggested in another answer to this question (now deleted), you will probably not get the result you are looking for.  That approach will serialize the list of users to a string, create a simple JValue from that, and then assign the JValue to the users property on the JObject .  If you examine the Type property of json[""users""] , you will see that it is String .  What this means is, if you later try to convert the JObject to JSON by using json.ToString() , you will get double-serialized output instead of the JSON you probably expect. Here is a short demo to illustrate the difference: class Program{    static void Main(string[] args)    {        List<User> list = new List<User>        {            new User { Id = 1, Username = ""john.smith"" },            new User { Id = 5, Username = ""steve.martin"" }        };        JObject json = new JObject();        json[""users""] = JToken.FromObject(list);        Console.WriteLine(""First approach ("" + json[""users""].Type + ""):"");        Console.WriteLine();        Console.WriteLine(json.ToString(Formatting.Indented));        Console.WriteLine();        Console.WriteLine(new string('-', 30));        Console.WriteLine();        json[""users""] = new JValue(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(list));        Console.WriteLine(""Second approach ("" + json[""users""].Type + ""):"");        Console.WriteLine();        Console.WriteLine(json.ToString(Formatting.Indented));    }    class User    {        public int Id { get; set; }        public string Username { get; set; }    }} Output: First approach (Array):{  ""users"": [    {      ""Id"": 1,      ""Username"": ""john.smith""    },    {      ""Id"": 5,      ""Username"": ""steve.martin""    }  ]}------------------------------Second approach (String):{  ""users"": ""[{\""Id\"":1,\""Username\"":\""john.smith\""},{\""Id\"":5,\""Username\"":\""steve.martin\""}]""}",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/1208030', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/68183/']}",jdg_325219

Question:
I have a Toast that is called from inside a Service . It always appears regardless of the state of the app, as designed. How can make it appear only when my app is in the foreground, and not when other apps are in front? That is, without moving it to Activity code.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","mparaz, There are a number of ways to do what you want very easily. Before I do that, I'd like to address a very important flaw in your question. An App is not an Activity, and an Activity is not an App. As such, an app cannot be in the foreground or background. That is reserved only for Activities. A quick example and then to you answer. Your Service is part of your Application. The application is loaded though the Activity is not. If your Application were not loaded, your Service could not run. I only emphasize this because it is an important philosophy in Android and understanding the correct use of these terms and the concepts that define them will make it so much easier for you in the future. A Simple Solution You may extend the Application object and hold a simple public flag in the class. Then you can set the flag to false anytime the activity goes to the background and true when it comes to the foreground (or vice versa, of course). Extending the Application: public class MyApplication extends Application{    static public boolean uiInForeground = false;} Setting the flag: In your Activity... //This may be done in onStart(), onResume(), onCreate()... //... whereever you decide it is important. //Note: The functions here do not include parameters (that's Eclipse's job).public void onStart(){//Notice the static call (no instance needed)    MyApplication.uiInForeground = true;}public void onPause(){    MyApplication.uiInForeground = false;} In your Service (where you call the Toast) if (MyApplication.uiInForeground)        Toast.makeText(someContext, myMsg).show(); It's really as simple as that. Oh yeah... Don't forget to tell the manifest that you are extending the Application.

Question:
I have a ""why does it work that way?"" question about garbage collection (any/all implementations: Java, Python, CLR, etc.).  Garbage collectors deallocate an object when it is no longer in any scope; the number of references pointing to it is zero.  It seems to me that a framework could deallocate as soon as the number of references reaches zero, but all implementations I've encountered wait a while and then deallocate many objects at a time.  My question is, why? I'm assuming that the framework keeps an integer for each object (which I think Python does, because you have to call PyINCREF and PyDECREF when writing extension modules for it in C; presumably these functions modify a real counter somewhere).  If so, then it shouldn't take any more CPU time to eliminate the object the moment it goes out of scope.  If it takes x nanoseconds per object now, then it would take x nanoseconds per object later, right? If my assumption is wrong and there is no integer associated with each object, then I understand why garbage collection waits: it would have to walk the graph of references to determine the status of each object, and that calculation takes time.  Such a method would consume less memory than the explicit reference-count method, but I'm astonished that it's quicker or is the preferred method for other reasons.  It sounds like a lot of work. From a programming point of view, it would be nice if objects deallocated immediately after they go out of scope.  Not only could we rely on destructors being executed when we want them to be (one of the Python gotchas is that __del__ is not called at a predictable time), but it would become much easier to memory-profile a program. Here's an example of how much confusion this causes.  To my mind, the benefits of programming in a deallocate-right-away framework are so great that there must be some good reason why all the implementations I've heard of wait before deallocating.  What is that benefit? Note: if the walk over the graph of references is only needed to identify circular references (a pure reference count can't), then why not a hybrid approach?  Deallocate objects as soon as their reference count hits zero and then also do periodic sweeps to look for circular references.  Programmers working in such a framework would have a performance/determinism reason to stick to non-circular references as much as is feasible.  It's often feasible (e.g. all data are in the form of JSON objects with no pointers to parents).  Is this how any popular garbage collectors work?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","To start with, a point of terminology: ""garbage collection"" means different things to different people, and some GC schemes are more sophisticated than others. Some people consider reference counting to be a form of GC, but personally I consider ""true GC"" to be distinct from reference counting. With refcounts, there is an integer tracking the number of references, and you can trigger deallocation immediately when the refcount hits zero. This us how the CPython implementation works, and how most varieties of C++ smart pointers work. The CPython implementation adds a mark/sweep GC as a backup, so it's very much like the hybrid design you describe. But refcounting is actually a pretty terrible solution, since it incurs a (relatively) expensive memory write (plus a memory barrier and/or lock, to ensure thread safety) every time a reference is passed, which happens quite a lot. In imperative languages like C++ it's possible (just difficult) to manage memory ownership through macros and coding conventions, but in functional languages like Lisp it becomes well-nigh impossible, because memory allocation usually happens implicitly due to local variable capture in a closure. So it should come as no surprise that the first step toward a modern GC was invented for Lisp. It was called the ""twospace allocator"" or ""twospace collector"" and it worked exactly like it sounds: it divided allocatable memory (the ""heap"") into two spaces. Every new object was allocated out of the first space until it got too full, at which point allocation would stop and the runtime would walk the reference graph and copy only the live (still referenced) objects to the second space. After the live objects were copied, the first space would be marked empty, and allocation would resume, allocating new objects from the second space, until it got too full, at which point the live objects would be copied back to the first space and the process would start all over again. The advantage of the twospace collector is that, instead of doing O(N) work, where N is the total number of garbage objects, it would only do O(M) work, where M is the number of objects that were not garbage . Since in practice, most objects are allocated and then deallocated in a short period of time, this can lead to a substantial performance improvement. Additionally, the twospace collector made it possible to simplify the allocator side as well. Most malloc() implementations maintain what is called a ""free list"": a list of which blocks are still available to be allocated. To allocate a new object, malloc() must scan the free list looking for an empty space that's big enough. But the twospace allocator didn't bother with that: it just allocated objects in each space like a stack, by just pushing a pointer up by the desired number of bytes. So the twospace collector was much faster than malloc() , which was great because Lisp programs would do a lot more allocations than C programs would. Or, to put it another way, Lisp programs needed a way to allocate memory like a stack but with a lifetime that was not limited to the execution stack -- in other words, a stack that could grow infinitely without the program running out of memory.  And, in fact, Raymond Chen argues that that's exactly how people should think about GC. I highly recommend his series of blog posts starting with Everybody thinks about garbage collection the wrong way . But the twospace collector had a major flaw, which is that no program could ever use more than half the available RAM: the other half was always wasted. So the history of GC techniques is the history of attempts to improve on the twospace collector, usually by using heuristics of program behavior. However, GC algorithms inevitably involve tradeoffs, usually preferring to deallocate objects in batches instead of individually, which inevitably leads to delays where objects aren't deallocated immediately. Edit: To answer your follow-up question, modern GCs generally incorporate the idea of generational garbage collection , where objects are grouped into different ""generations"" based on lifetime, and an object in one generation gets ""promoted"" to another generation once it's lived long enough.  Sometimes a small difference in object lifetime (e.g. in a request-driven server, storing an object for longer than one request) can lead to a large difference in the amount of time it takes before the object gets deallocated, since it causes it to become more ""tenured"". You correctly observe that a true GC has to operate ""beneath"" the level of malloc() and free() .  (As a side note, it's worth learning about how malloc() and free() are implemented -- they aren't magic either!)  Additionally, for an effective GC, you either need to be conservative (like the Boehm GC) and never move objects, and check things that might be pointers, or else you need some kind of ""opaque pointer"" type -- which Java and C# call ""references"".  Opaque pointers are actually great for an allocation system, since it means you can always move objects by updating pointers to them.  In a language like C where you interact directly with raw memory addresses, it's never really safe to move objects. And there are multiple options for GC algorithms.  The standard Java runtime contains no less than five collectors (Young, Serial, old CMS, new CMS, and G1, although I think I'm forgetting one) and each has a set of options that are all configurable. However, GCs aren't magic.  Most GCs are just exploiting the time-space tradeoff of batching work, which means that the gains in speed are usually paid for in increased memory usage (compared to manual memory management or refcounting).  But the combination of increased program performance and increased programmer performance, versus the low cost of RAM these days, makes the tradeoff usually worth it. Hopefully that helps make things clearer!",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/17646509', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1623645/']}",jdg_125734

","When a surface element $d\omega$ at a point $P$ in three-space is projected orthogonally into all possible directions then the average area of the image is $\rho\thinspace d\omega$ where $\rho$ is a universal constant. To determine the value of $\rho$ we argue as follows: The unit sphere $S^2$ has a surface area of $4\pi$, and the area of its projection is $2\pi$ in all directions (note that the ""shadow"" is doubly covered); whence also the average area of the projection is $2\pi$. So $\rho$ must be ${1\over2}$. What we have found out is valid for any surface element $d\omega$ of your ellipsoid $E$. It follows that the average area of the shadow of $E$ is equal to $\omega(E)/4$, where $\omega(E)$ is the total surface area of $E$ and we have taken into account that the shadow is covered twice. The value so obtained can be expressed as an elliptic integral in terms of $a$, $b$, $c$.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/14947', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/4964/']}",jdg_249375

Question:
Given the below code, I wonder why referenceValue = ConstantInt; is valid while referenceValue = StaticInt; fails to compile. namespace Demo{    public class Class1    {        private const int ConstantInt = 42;        private static readonly int StaticInt = 42;        public void DemoMethod(ref uint referenceValue)        {            referenceValue = ConstantInt; // This compiles            referenceValue = StaticInt; // This claims that the source type 'int' cannot be converted to 'unit' implicitly.         }    }}

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Constants are replaced at compile time with their respective value. So from the compiler perspective this referenceValue = ConstantInt; is the same as this referenceValue = 42 . While readonly fields feel similar, they are not. Their value is not truly known at compile time. They are backed by a static field on the class. Their value can be computed, even modified from a static constructor, so the compiler can't check that the value is within the range of uint at compile time. For example: public class Class1{    private const int ConstantInt = 42;    private static readonly int StaticInt = 42;    static Class1()    {        StaticInt = -20;    }    public void DemoMethod(ref uint referenceValue)    {        referenceValue = StaticInt; // it's -20    }} Edit As pointed out in the comments not all assignments from constants to variables work, long constant to int variable does not work without an explicit cast. This behavior is the same based on the type of the constant, regardless   of whether it is a named constant or an inline constant: private const long ConstantInt = 42;// Both of these will cause an error:referenceValue = ConstantInt; // can't be converted implicitlyreferenceValue = 42L; // but neither can an inline long constant (the L makes it long)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/48379279', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3169348/']}",jdg_320536

Question:
In my app I have a global custom font applied to all labels like so: UIFont *font = [UIFont fontWithName:kMyFontName size:15.0]; [[UILabel appearance] setFont:font]; This works fine.  However, in some cases I want to be able to specify a different font for a specific region of a UILabel string. So I have something like this: NSString *string = @""Foo Bar Baz"";UIFont *boldFont = [UIFont fontWithName:kMyBoldFontName size:15.0]; NSMutableAttributedString *attrString = [[NSMutableAttributedString alloc] initWithString:string];[attrString setAttributes:@{ NSFontAttributeName: boldFont } range:NSMakeRange(0, 3)];self.myLabel.attributedText = attrString; However this doesn't seem to work.  I expect the ""Foo"" to be bold, but the entire string just has the default font. It's as if the bold font is not applied at all and is being overwritten by the font set on the UILabel appearance proxy. When I remove the UILabel appearance line then it works fine (I can see part of the string in bold).  Basically I want to have my custom font applied to the label but a separate font applied to a different region of the string. Normally this works fine with attributed strings but for some reason setting the UILabel appearance font disables this functionality (or so it seems). Expected results: "" Foo Bar Baz"" Actual results: ""Foo Bar Baz"" If I remove the [[UILabel appearance] setFont:] line then it works: "" Foo Bar Baz"" (but the custom font is not set on the rest of the string). So my question is: Is there a way to specify a single font to use as the default app-wide but still be able to partially override that using attributed strings? Also if someone can explain to me why this is not working I'd appreciate it.

Question:
We wanted to use company specific Tags to the resources that we create in AWS for billing purposes. I am using a cloud formation template to spin up our Elasticbeanstalk instance and other project dependent resources. When I use the CloudFormation console to create a stack it asks me for Tags in the page after parameters. I have to manually input the Tags for that stack. However is there a way to specify those Tags (Tags for the stack) with in the cloud formation template itself? That way the Tag gets propagated to the other resources? I know that the cloud formation automatically tags the resources with the stack name. But we need company specific tags to bill separate departments.

","When launching AWS CloudFormation, the tags being requested will be applied to the CloudFormation Stack itself and (where possible) will also be propagated to the resources launched by the Stack.

","In your particular case, Regex is actually faster... but it is likely because you use EndsWith with many OR and redundant ToString() . If you simplify the logic, simple string operation will likely be faster. Here is the performance summary for text processing - from the fastest to the slowest (10 millions loop [Prefer/Non-Prefer 32-bit] - rank is ordered based on the fastest of the two): Large Lookup Fast Random UInt (not counted for bounty): 219/273 ms - Mine, improved from Evk's Large Lookup Optimized Random: 228/273 ms - Ivan Stoev's Alternate Solution Large Lookup Fast Random: 238/294 ms - Evk's Alternative Solution Large Lookup Parameterless Random: 248/287 ms - Thomas Ayoub There are few notes I want to make on this solution (based on the comments below it): This solution introduces 0.0039% bias towards small numbers (< 100000) (ref: Eric Lippert's blog post , linked by Lucas Trzesniewski ) Does not generate the same number sequence as others while being tested (ref: Michael Liu 's comment ) - since it changes the way to use Random (from Random.Next(int) to Random.Next() ), which is used for the testing itself. While the testing cannot be performed with the exact same number sequence for this method as for the rests (as mentioned by Phil1970 ), I have two points to make: Some might be interested to look at the implement of Random.Next() vs Random.Next(int) to understand why this solution will still be faster even if the same sequence of numbers are used . The use of Random in the real case itself will (most of the time) not assume the number sequence to be the same (or predictable) - It is only for testing our method we want the Random sequence to be identical (for fair unit testing purpose). The expected faster result for this method cannot be fully derived from the testing result alone , but by also looking at the Next() vs Next(int) implementation.

Question:
I've been looking into using iterators for batch processing in Doctrine ( http://docs.doctrine-project.org/en/2.0.x/reference/batch-processing.html ). I've got a database with 20,000 images which I would like to iterate over. I understand that using an iterator is supposed to prevent Doctrine from loading every row in memory. However the memory usage between the two examples is almost exactly the same. I am calculating the memory usage before and after using (memory_get_usage() / 1024) . $query = $this->em->createQuery('SELECT i FROM Acme\Entities\Image i');$iterable = $query->iterate();while (($image = $iterable->next()) !== false) {    // Do something here!} Memory usage for the iterator. Memory usage before: 2823.36328125 KBMemory usage after: 50965.3125 KB This second example loads the entire result set into memory using the findAll method. $images = $this->em->getRepository('Acme\Entities\Image')->findAll(); Memory usage for findAll . Memory usage before: 2822.828125 KBMemory usage after: 51329.03125 KB

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Batch processing with doctrine is trickier than it seems, even with the help of iterate() and IterableResult . Just as you expected greatest benefit of IterableResult is that it does not load all of the elements into memory, and the second benefit is that it doesn't hold references to the entities you load, thus IterableResult doesn't prevent GC from freeing memory from your entity. However there's another object Doctrine's EntityManager (more specifically UnitOfWork ) which holds all the references to each object which you queried explicitly or implicitly ( EAGER associations). In simple words, whenever you get any entity(ies) returned by findAll() findOneBy() even through DQL queries and also IterableResult , then a reference to each of those entities is saved inside of doctrine. The reference is simply stored in an assoc array, here's pseudocode: $identityMap['Acme\Entities\Image'][0] = $image0; So because upon each iteration of your loop, your previous images (despite not being present in the loop's scope or IterableResult 's scope) are still present inside of this identityMap , GC cannot clean them and your memory consumption is the same as when you were calling findAll() . Now let's go through the code and see what is actually happening $query = $this->em->createQuery('SELECT i FROM Acme\Entities\Image i');  // here doctrine only creates Query object, no db access here$iterable = $query->iterate();// unlike findAll(), upon this call no db access happens.  // Here the Query object is simply wrapped in an Iterator  while (($image_row = $iterable->next()) !== false) {      // now upon the first call to next() the DB WILL BE ACCESSED FOR THE FIRST TIME    // the first resulting row will be returned    // row will be hydrated into Image object    // ----> REFERENCE OF OBJECT WILL BE SAVED INSIDE $identityMap <----    // the row will be returned to you via next()    // to access actual Image object, you need to take [0]th element of the array                                 $image = $image_row[0];    // Do something here!     write_image_data_to_file($image,'myimage.data.bin');        //now as the loop ends, the variables $image (and $image_row) will go out of scope     // and from what we see should be ready for GC    // however because reference to this specific image object is still held    // by the EntityManager (inside of $identityMap), GC will NOT clean it }// and by the end of your loop you will consume as much memory// as you would have by using `findAll()`. So the first solution is to actually tell Doctrine EntityManager to detach the object from the $identityMap .  I also replaced while loop to foreach to make it more readable. foreach($iterable as $image_row){    $image = $image_row[0];     // do something with the image    write_image_data_to_file($image);        $entity_manager->detach($image);    // this line will tell doctrine to remove the _reference_to_the_object_     // from identity map. And thus object will be ready for GC} However the example above has few flaws, even though it is featured in the doctrine's documentation on batch processing . It works well, in case your entity Image isn't performing EAGER load for any of it's associations. But if you're EAGERly loading any of the associations eg. : /*  @ORM\Entity*/class Image {    /*     @ORM\Column(type=""integer"")    @ORM\Id    */  private $id;    /*    @ORM\Column(type=""string"")  */  private $imageName;  /*   @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity=""Acme\Entity\User"", fetch=""EAGER"")   This association will be automatically (EAGERly) loaded by doctrine   every time you query from db Image entity. Whether by findXXX(),DQL or iterate()  */  private $owner;  // getters/setters left out for clarity} So if we use same piece of the code as above, upon foreach($iterable as $image_row){    $image = $image_row[0];     // here becuase of EAGER loading, we already have in memory owner entity    // which can be accessed via $image->getOwner()     // do something with the image    write_image_data_to_file($image);        $entity_manager->detach($image);    // here we detach Image entity, but `$owner` `User` entity is still    // referenced in the doctrine's `$identityMap`. Thus we are leaking memory still.   } The possible solution can be to use EntityManager::clear() instead or EntityManager::detach() which will clear COMPLETELY the identity map. foreach($iterable as $image_row){    $image = $image_row[0];     // here becuase of EAGER loading, we already have in memory owner entity    // which can be accessed via $image->getOwner()     // do something with the image    write_image_data_to_file($image);        $entity_manager->clear();    // now ``$identityMap` will be cleared of ALL entities it has    // the `Image` the `User` loaded in this loop iteration and as as    // SIDE EFFECT all OTHER Entities which may have been loaded by you    // earlier. Thus you when you start this loop you must NOT rely    // on any entities you have `persist()`ed or `remove()`ed     // all changes since the last `flush()` will be lost.   } So hope this helps to understand doctrine iteration a little bit.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/23545768', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/-1/']}",jdg_289511

I've noticed that video games like Fallout 4 depict the plasma fired from plasma weapons as green.  Is there a way hot plasma can look green in real life?  I know some gases emit green light when ionized by a current, but is there any other way?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You won't get green from thermal emissions. The sun is emitting primarily green at 5800K and it looks white. That's because of the physiological response of our eyes. Higher temperatures will cause slightly blueish impressions, but green is not associated with a thermal spectrum. That leaves us with spectral lines... xenon-nitrogen seems to be one of the few gas mixtures that can emit a line spectrum that looks somewhat green. Having said that... a xenon-nitrogen plasma canon would be about as ""effective"" as blowing kisses. In short: it's just artistic freedom. Having said that... there is a way to make really ""green fire"" chemically: boron. Just make sure that you don't produce boranes (boron-hydrogen compounds, which can be quite toxic). Boron and borates seem to be relatively benign and they are freely available, if I am not mistaken. I would crosscheck with the chemists about the potential toxicity and safety hazards before you try any experiments with ""green fire"" on your own.

Question:
In reinforcement learning, I saw many notions with respect to control and prediction , like Monte Carlo prediction and Monte Carlo control. But what are we actually predicting and controlling?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The difference between prediction and control is to do with goals regarding the policy. The policy describes the way of acting depending on current state, and in the literature is often noted as $\pi(a|s)$, the probability of taking action $a$ when in state $s$. So, my question is for prediction, predict what? A prediction task in RL is where the policy is supplied, and the goal is to measure how well it performs. That is, to predict the expected total reward from any given state assuming the function $\pi(a|s)$ is fixed. for control, control what？ A control task in RL is where the policy is not fixed, and the goal is to find the optimal policy. That is, to find the policy $\pi(a|s)$ that maximises the expected total reward from any given state. A control algorithm based on value functions (of which Monte Carlo Control is one example) usually works by also solving the prediction problem, i.e. it predicts the values of acting in different ways, and adjusts the policy to choose the best actions at each step. As a result, the output of the value-based algorithms is usually an approximately optimal policy and the expected future rewards for following that policy.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/340462', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/132651/']}",jdg_296054

Question:
we use models with multiplicative interaction effects when relationship between independent variable and dependent variable are non-additive. My question is, Are all models with multiplicative interaction effects non-linear? and all models with additive interaction effects linear? Also, With non-linearity, the effect of independent variable on dependent variable depends on the value of independent variable, in effect, independent variable somehow interacts with itself. Does that mean that an independent variable(x1) interacts with itself(x1)? or does it mean that independent variables(x1) interact with other independent variables(x2, x3...) and not with itself? I am confused with concepts of of linearity, non-linearity, additivity and non-additivity (multiplicativity). Any help is much appreciated.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","we use models with multiplicative interaction effects when relationship between independent variable and dependent variable are non-additive. My question is, Are all models with multiplicative interaction effects non-linear? and all models with additive interaction effects linear? The answer to such a question depends on what you mean when you say 'linear' and 'nonlinear', and what domain of models you're restricting yourself to. Usually the terms 'linear' and 'nonlinear' in statistical models refers to linearity in the parameters , not the variables. So for example, $y = \alpha x^2 +\epsilon$ is linear in $\alpha$ though not in $x$, while $y = \exp(-\alpha) x +\epsilon$ is non-linear in $\alpha$, though it is in $x$. In usual parlance, the first is a linear model and the second is not. However, in those cases at least both may be turned into models that are linear in both the parameters and the predictors - in the first case by the transformation $x^* = x^2$, giving a model that has a linear relationship between $y$ and $x^*$, and in the second case by the reparameterization $\alpha^* = \exp(-\alpha)$. As such a standard general linear model (regression-type model) with multiplicative interaction is linear in the parameters , even though it's not linear in either predictor (IV). However, note that even in terms of the IVs, it is conditionally linear - fix one of the IVs and the relationship is linear in the other. [Minor mathematical aside: It should be noted that when we're taking about the relationships of $y$ and some $x$ being linear (in this sense rather than the 'makes a straight-line' sense), if we recognize we're using homogeneous co-ordinates in regression, it is linear . I mention it because I have seen people with enough mathematical background to be familiar with the mathematical definition of linearity object that 'linear regression is not linear'.] all models with additive interaction effects linear? If I understand what you're even asking with 'additive interaction effects', there's really no such thing. If it's additive it's already in the main effects and there's nothing left over for some notional 'interaction'. Also, With non-linearity, the effect of independent variable on dependent variable depends on the value of independent variable, Only if you think of 'effect' as inherently linear in effect, independent variable somehow interacts with itself. This way lies much confusion. Why not just think of there being a relationship that's described by some curve rather than by a straight line? -- Edit to address followup questions: What do you mean when you say ""what domain of models you're restricting yourself to""? When you said ""all models with multiplicative interaction effects"" you presumably meant 'all models' in some class, such as regression models, or general linear models, or generalized linear models , or ... the list could go on for some time. Thanks! for noting about linearity. For the longest time, even I thought being linear meant the relationship was a straight line. Me too. This does clear some doubts, but raises a few questions. So, if we recognize we're using homogeneous co-ordinates in regression, it is linear. In terms of $x$'s - the actual columns of the $X$-matrix in a regression - it's linear in that linked mathematical sense if you realize you're working with homogeneous co-ordinates. A multiple linear regression is already linear in the mean parameters (i.e. the $\beta$ vector, the parameters other than $\sigma^2$), without any such need to invoke homogeneous co-ordinates. That I was referring to the relationship with the $x$'s when I raised homogeneous co-ordinates was explicitly stated. Also, Did you mean to say ""Only if you think of 'effect' as inherently nonlinear instead of linear? Nope. The way you phrased the question I was responding to only makes sense if you take the word 'effect' to imply linearity, otherwise the whole notion of 'interaction with itself' seems to be utterly meaningless. How is one to interpret the phrase? What I meant to ask was. I read somewhere that ""with non-linearity, the effect of X on Y depends on the value of X and X somehow interacts with itself"". I regard the statement as an unhelpful attempt at analogy, and, as already explained, I think you should not think about it this way. Not everything that someone writes down is useful. Does this mean that X interacts with itself(X)? or does it mean that X interact with other variables(X,W etc.) if any? I'm not going to make any further attempt to interpret something that doesn't really make sense as a bare, general, statement without first having more clarification of its intent. I've suggested a way to interpret it that makes at least a little sense. If you want to interpret it more generally, explaining what it means would be up to you - or the original author of it. I expect if you were to ask ""what, exactly, does it mean*, you would receive an answer that contained a number of hidden premises, and one of those premises would rely, directly or indirectly, on taking underlying meaning of 'effects' to be linear, when we have no good reason to do that.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/52644', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/21650/']}",jdg_170911

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It's possible to retrieve the desirable standard SQLSTATE errcode, but there's a trick: the query has to be sent through the asynchronous pg_send_query() instead of the synchronous pg_query() . This is because pg_query() returns false on error instead of the resource that is required to peek at the error details. When pg_get_result() is called after pg_send_query , it will block anyway until the query is done, so it does not really complicate things compared to the synchronous case.And it returns a result which can be fully exploited for precise error handling. Example: if (pg_send_query($db, $query)) {  $res=pg_get_result($db);  if ($res) {    $state = pg_result_error_field($res, PGSQL_DIAG_SQLSTATE);    if ($state==0) {      // success    }    else {      // some error happened      if ($state==""23505"") { // unique_violation        // process specific error      }      else {       // process other errors      }    }  }  } Also, if the argument passed to pg_query might contain several SQL statements (separated by semicolons), the above example should be extended to retrieve all results in a loop, as mentioned in the comment by @user1760150.

Question:
This is totally elementary, but I have no idea how to solve it: let $A$ be an abelian group such that $A$ is isomorphic to $A^3$ . is then $A$ isomorphic to $A^2$ ? probably no, but how construct a counterexample? you can also ask this in other categories as well, for example rings. if you restrict to Boolean rings, the question becomes a topological one which makes you think about fractals: let $X$ be Stone space such that $X \cong X + X + X$ , does it follow that $X \cong X + X$ (here $+$ means disjoint union)? Edit : In the answers there are already counterexamples. but you may add others in other categories (with products/coproducts), especially if they are easy to understand :).

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The answer to the first question is no.  That is, there exists an abelian group $A$ isomorphic to $A^3$ but not $A^2$ .  This result is due to A.L.S. (Tony) Corner, and is the case $r = 2$ of the theorem described in the following Mathematical Review. MR0169905 Corner, A.L.S., On a conjecture of Pierce concerning direct decomposition of Abelian groups. 1964 Proc. Colloq. Abelian Groups (Tihany, 1963) pp.43--48 Akademiai Kiado, Budapest. It is shown that for any positive integer $r$ there exists a countable torsion-free abelian group $G$ such that the direct sum of $m$ copies of $G$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of $n$ copies of $G$ if and only if $m \equiv n \pmod r$ .  This remarkable result is obtained from the author's theorem on the existence of torsion-free groups having a prescribed countable, reduced, torsion-free endomorphism ring by constructing a ring with suitable properties.  It should be mentioned that the question of the existence of algebraic systems with the property stated above has been considered by several mathematicians.  The author has been too generous in crediting this ""conjecture"" to the reviewer. Reviewed by R.S.

","As requested, here is the answer with some extra explanation. The error ""client denied by server configuration"" has some very specific causes, all of which are detailed here http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/ClientDeniedByServerConfiguration As I mentioned in the comment,  <Directory> blocks do not affect any request that is proxied as they only affect requests that Apache itself maps to a file system path. Look for any Location or Files blocks that are allowing/denying access to thebase URI path or .php files. The solution I proposed which seems to have worked was to add the following block to the virtual host. <Location />  require all granted</Location> I would still suggest looking for other Location/Files blocks in the remainder of your configuration as there should be something else that caused the requests to be denied originally.

Question:
I added some Fragment into a TableLayout and I want to manage them from my container Activity , so I used this: Fragment fragment = (Fragment) tableLayout.getChildAt(i); but getChildAt(int) returns a View and a View could NOT cast to Fragment

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I don't understand why people are down-voting your question. Fragments can be very confusing at times, especially for beginners. To understand your problem, you must learn what is a Fragment and how they are used. To start with, a View is something that has an existence on the screen. Examples include: TextView , EditText , Button , etc. They are placed inside ""layouts"" written in Xml or Java/Kotlin. These layouts are shown using an Activity . Now, a Fragment is not a View . It does not have any existence on the screen at all. Instead, it's a class that simply manages a ""layout"" — kinda similar to an Activity . If you need the View returned by your Fragment's onCreateView() , you can directly use findViewById() within your Activity . If you need a reference to your Fragment, there are two possible ways of doing this: 1) If you added the Fragment programmatically like this getFragmentManager()    .beginTransaction()    .replace(R.id.fragment_container_viewgroup, myFragment, FRAGMENT_TAG)    .commit(); You can use: MyFragment myFragment = (MyFragment) getFragmentManager().findFragmentByTag(FRAGMENT_TAG); 2) If you added the Fragment inside an XML layout like this: <fragment android:name=""com.example.android.fragments.HeadlinesFragment""    android:id=""@+id/fragmentContainer""    android:layout_weight=""1""    android:layout_width=""0dp""    android:layout_height=""match_parent"" /> You can use this: getFragmentManager().findFragmentById(R.id.fragmentContainer); Basically, each Activity has a FragmentManager class that maintains all the active Fragments , and there are two ways of finding them: Using a unique TAG that you pass while showing a fragment, or passing the container view-ID where the fragment was added.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/31743695', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3257579/']}",jdg_313946

Question:
These are two very popular ways of formatting a string in Python. One is using a dict : >>> 'I will be %(years)i on %(month)s %(day)i' % {'years': 21, 'month': 'January', 'day': 23}'I will be 21 on January 23' And the other one using a simple tuple : >>> 'I will be %i on %s %i' % (21, 'January', 23)'I will be 21 on January 23' The first one is way more readable, but the second one is faster to write. I actually use them indistinctly. What are the pros and cons of each one? regarding performance, readability, code optimization (is one of them transformed to the other?) and anything else you would think is useful to share.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Why format() is more flexible than % string operations I think you should really stick to format() method of str , because it is the preferred way to format strings and will probably replace string formatting operation in the future. Furthermore, it has some really good features, that can also combine position-based formatting with keyword-based one : >>> string = 'I will be {} years and {} months on {month} {day}'>>> some_date = {'month': 'January', 'day': '1st'}>>> diff = [3, 11] # years, months>>> string.format(*diff, **some_date)'I will be 3 years and 11 months on January 1st' even the following will work: >>> string = 'On {month} {day} it will be {1} months, {0} years'>>> string.format(*diff, **some_date)'On January 1st it will be 11 months, 3 years' There is also one other reason in favor of format() . Because it is a method, it can be passed as a callback like in the following example: >>> data = [(1, 2), ('a', 'b'), (5, 'ABC')]>>> formatter = 'First is ""{0[0]}"", then comes ""{0[1]}""'.format>>> for item in map(formatter, data):    print itemFirst is ""1"", then comes ""2""First is ""a"", then comes ""b""First is ""5"", then comes ""ABC"" Isn't it a lot more flexible than string formatting operation? See more examples on documentation page for comparison between % operations and .format() method. Comparing tuple-based % string formatting with dictionary-based Generally there are three ways of invoking % string operations (yes, three , not two ) like that: base_string % values and they differ by the type of values (which is a consequence of what is the content of base_string ): it can be a tuple , then they are replaced one by one, in the order they are appearing in tuple, >>> 'Three first values are: %f, %f and %f' % (3.14, 2.71, 1)'Three first values are: 3.140000, 2.710000 and 1.000000' it can be a dict (dictionary), then they are replaced based on the keywords, >>> 'My name is %(name)s, I am %(age)s years old' % {'name':'John','age':98}'My name is John, I am 98 years old' it can be a single value, if the base_string contains single place where the value should be inserted: >>> 'This is a string: %s' % 'abc''This is a string: abc' There are obvious differences between them and these ways cannot be combined (in contrary to format() method which is able to combine some features, as mentioned above). But there is something that is specific only to dictionary-based string formatting operation and is rather unavailable in remaining three formatting operations' types. This is ability to replace specificators with actual variable names in a simple manner : >>> name = 'John'>>> surname = 'Smith'>>> age = 87# some code goes here>>> 'My name is %(surname)s, %(name)s %(surname)s. I am %(age)i.' % locals()'My name is Smith, John Smith. I am 87.' Just for the record: of course the above could be easily replaced by using format() by unpacking the dictionary like that: >>> 'My name is {surname}, {name} {surname}. I am {age}.'.format(**locals())'My name is Smith, John Smith. I am 87.' Does anyone else have an idea what could be a feature specific to one type of string formatting operation, but not to the other? It could be quite interesting to hear about it.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/8395925', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/972208/']}",jdg_72072

Question:
I want to analyze a stream object in a PDF file which is encoded using /FlateDecode . Are there any tools which allow one to decode such encoding (ASCII85decode, LZWDecode, RunlenghtDecode etc.) used in PDFs? The stream content is most likely a PE file structure, which the PDF probably will use later in the exploit. Also, there are two xref tables in the PDF, that is alright but also two %%EOF which follow the xref . Is the presence of these allright?

","""Two xref tables and two %%EOF ""? This alone is not an indication of a malicious PDF file. There can by two or even more instances of each, if the file was generated via the ""incremental update"" feature.

Question:
I was wondering what ""a mapping factors over another mapping"" generally means? Does it have something to do with commutative diagram in category theory? I have seen this usage in different situations, and would like to give examples, but cannot recall them one by one except the most recent one from Fiber bundle : Mappings which factor over the projection map are known as bundle  maps. Thanks and regards!

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As was pointed out in the comments: Given a morphism $f:A \to C$ and a morphism $g: A \to B$ then $f$ is said to factor over $g$ if there exists $h: B \to C$ such that $hg = f$. Note that $h$ is unique as soon as $g$ is an epimorphism . In the case of bundles $\pi_{E}: E \to M$ and $\pi_F: F \to N$ then a map $\varphi: E \to F$ is a bundle map if there exists $f:M \to N$ such that $\pi_{F} \varphi = \varphi \pi_{E}$, as is noted further down on the wikipedia page you linked to . So $\varphi : E \to F$ is a bundle map if and only if $\pi_{F} \varphi$ factors over $\pi_{E}$ via a (necessarily unique) map $f: M \to N$, as the bundle projections are assumed to be surjective. Note that this means in particular that $\varphi$ maps fibers to fibers. Similarly, there is the notion of factoring through (you need to scroll down a little). I'm mostly using this for the situation $f: A \to C$ and $h: B \to C$ then $f$ factors through $h$ if there is $g: A \to B$ such that $f = hg$. If $h$ happens to be a monomorphism then $g$ is unique (if it exists). However, the distinction I'm making in this post are far from universally accepted. You'll also find $f:A \to C$ factors through $B$ if there are maps $g: A \to B$ and $h: B \to C$ such that $f = hg$ and so on, $f$ factors through $g$, $f$ factors through $h$ in this same situation. Basically, all it means is that $f$ can be decomposed as $f = hg$ in some way that should be obvious from the context. To repeat, if either $h$ is a monomorphism then $g$ is unique and if $g$ is an epimorphism then $h$ is unique.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/57404', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/1281/']}",jdg_113337

Question:
Some programming languages offer the ability to perform a regex replacement dynamically. For instance, say we have a string like foo:$USER:$GROUP , where $USER and $GROUP will be replaced by their environment variables. The transformed string would look something like foo:john:admin . To solve this problem, we have to take all the strings matching \$[A-Za-z]+ and look up the environment variable value. In PHP, the following looks like this: <?phppreg_replace_callback(   # the regular expression to match the shell variables.   '/\$[A-Za-z]+/',   # Function that takes in the matched string and returns the environment   # variable value.   function($m) {     return getenv(substr($m[0], 1));  },  # The input string.

Some context, though I doubt it matters:""foo"" is Unity's FixedUpdate, ""bar"" is just some functionality that I need to change for children, but since I do other stuff on FixedUpdate, I don't want to copy the whole method only to change that one line.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Is there any way that, when foo is called from the child class, Child's bar will be called, instead of Parent's? Yes, but that feature is off by default in C#, unlike Java. In C# you turn it on like this: public class Base{  protected void foo()  {    bar();  }  protected virtual void bar()  {    thing_a();  }}public class Derived : Base{  protected override void bar()  {    thing_b();  }} I note that you should have gotten a compiler warning explaining that this program looks wrong .  Did you ignore the warning? Stop ignoring compiler warnings; they are there to inform you of your possible mistakes. If you intend to have two methods of the same name but not override each other then first explain why that is , because that is a strange thing to want and almost certainly wrong.  Second, you indicate that to the compiler with new : public class Base{  protected void foo()  {    bar();  }  protected void bar()  {    thing_a();  }}public class Derived : Base{  protected new void bar()  {    thing_b();  }} Finally, a common pattern is to have the overriding method call the overridden method. You can do that like this: public class Base{  protected void foo()  {    bar();  }  protected virtual void bar()  {    thing_a();  }}public class Derived : Base{  protected override void bar()  {    thing_b();    base.bar();  }} Now a call to this.bar from foo will call thing_b() and then thing_a() .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/49926078', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/6768076/']}",jdg_223922

Below is a question asked on the forum mathoverflow.net. Provide a good and informational response to it like a helpful human would.

Question:
Motivated by Question 405105 , I found the following Conjecture. $2^{2n}-2^n+1 \equiv 0 \pmod {433}$ and $n=4m$ iff $$\phi(m) = \phi(i + j) = \phi(i) + \phi(j) ,$$ and $$\phi(m) = \phi(ik) = \phi(i)\phi(k),$$ for some $i, j, k$ , where $\phi$ is the Euler totient function. Numerical computation indicates that it is true for $1≤m≤500$ . m = 3, 15, 21, 33, 39, 51, 57, 69, 75, 87, 93, 105, 111, 123, 129, 141, 147, 159, 165, 177, 183, 195, 201, 213, 219, 231, 237, 249, 255, 267, 273, 285, 291, 303, 309, 321, 327, 339, 345, 357, 363, 375, 381, 393, 399, 411, 417, 429, 435, 447, 453, 465, 471, 483, 489. See A306771 for details. Question. Why 433? And how to prove ""iff""? ADDED Noting $\phi(ik)=\phi(i)\phi(k)\frac{\gcd(i,k)}{\phi(\gcd(i,k))}$ , we have $$\phi(ik)=\phi(i)\phi(k) \iff \phi(\gcd(i,k))=\gcd(i,k)\iff\gcd(i,k)=1. $$

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Since $2$ has multiplicative order $72$ modulo $433$ , it is easy to check with a quick computation that $2^{2n}-2^n+1\equiv 0\pmod{433}$ holds iff $n\equiv\pm 12\pmod{72}$ , or $m\equiv\pm 3\pmod{18}$ . In particular, $m$ is divisible by $3$ , say $m=3l$ , and $l$ is odd and not divisible by $3$ . Therefore for $i=l,j=2l$ and $k=3$ we have $\phi(m)=\phi(3l)=2\phi(l)$ while $\phi(i)=\phi(l),\phi(j)=\phi(2l)=\phi(l),\phi(k)=2$ , making the equalities in the conjecture true. As for why $433$ - I suspect it is just a numerical coincidence which happens to capture $m$ modulo $18$ .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/405183', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/287674/']}",jdg_88462

Question:
I need to detect quick (~200ms) voltage drop, so I am thinking of making an oscilloscope with Arduino. Problem is - can I reliably read 600V DC voltage and what resistor values should I choose for voltage divider? Can I apply same rules as for lower voltage (150k and 1k ohm)? Is there a limit what value difference can be between resistors?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","can I reliably read 600V DC voltage You can. But safety first - take all the necessary safety precautions. 600 VDC is high enough to make you have an eternal dream . There are 4 more things you must consider: Voltage rating of the resistors: Check the maximum allowed voltage of the resistors you are planning to use. For example, 1206 case SMD resistors can be used up to 200 VDC, IIRC. So you'll need to connect the upper resistors in series, if you are planning to use SMD resistors. Total power dissipation of the divider resistors: 600 VDC is not low therefore will cause significant loss across the resistors. And, obviously, the resistors will  heat up. Input impedance of the ADC: This determines how large resistors you can choose. You can select ridiculously high value resistors to decrease the power dissipation but they'll interact with the input impedance of the ADC. And this will lead to false measurements. Reading range: High value resistors bring higher noise. So if you drop the voltage to millivolts range it'll probably be noisy. This will lead to false measurements.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/641762', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/275534/']}",jdg_105608

Question:
I might sound a bit weird but, is there a way? For example, I have a PHP object $foo . Is there a way to store this object in an HTML form (hidden input) by some object encrypting function and later retrieved with decryption function. Similarly, can I pass these objects through GET method?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Like pointed out elsewhere already, you can use serialize to turn the object into a string. $foo = (object) array(    'foo' => 'foo & bär',    'bar' => new StdClass);$serialized = serialize($foo); This gives: O:8:""stdClass"":2:{s:3:""foo"";s:10:""foo & bär"";s:3:""bar"";O:8:""stdClass"":0:{}} As you can see there is quotes in that string, so you cannot insert that into a link without risking breaking your markup: <a href=""http://example.com?s=O:8:"" <-- quote closes href So at the very least you'd have to htmlspecialchars or urlencode that output. However, that would still leave the content easily readable. You could make use of PHP's MCrypt library to put some strong encryption on the string. But if the data really is that sensitive, you should probably find another means of transferal, away from the public facing portion of your site. If the data is less sensitive, then you can probably safe some CPU cycles by just obfuscating the string. The easiest way to do that is to run it through gzdeflate : echo gzdeflate(serialize($foo)); gives something like R*.Iq�I,.V�2��.�2�RJ��W�.�24 … Using gzdeflate will also shorten large serialized strings. The drawback is, it produces output unfit for transferal via HTTP, so you also have to base64_encode that: echo base64_encode(gzdeflate(serialize($foo))); which will then give 87eysFIqLklxzkksLlayMrKqLrYytlJKy89Xsi62MjQAMxXUFJIOLykCiQDlkhKBLH9UfQZW1bW1AA== And that's safe for transferal and also pretty obfuscated from the original serialized string. Because we have compressed the string before we base64'ed it, anyone smart enough to figure out it's base64 will still have to make sense of the compressed string when trying to reverse it. To turn the string back into an object, you then do unserialize(    gzinflate(        base64_decode(            $obfuscatedString        )    )) and get your object back. Demo A note on Security The above is still insecure. You should not rely on obfuscation for security. If you transfer an object or an entire object graph via HTTP, you have to consider them as user input on the receiving end. User input cannot be trusted . Malicious users figuring out how the string was obfuscated can provide an altered input. Because you are unserializing objects back into the program flow, you have to be absolutely paranoid about the resulting object.

Question:
as far as I understand are spring controllers stateless right? If I set a field to a value, this is revoked by the next call. Is there a possibility to add a init-method or something? A method which is called once, when my controller is triggerd? I'm using spring 3.0 and a annotation configuration atm.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Spring Controllers should be handled stateless by default, that is correct. Nevertheless this does not mean your value will be revoked by the next call. From the programmers perspective it is not decidable if you end up with same instance of your controller or a different instance. It is further more not assured that no one else used the controller (and therefore changed its state in the meantime). This is why it is not advisable to save any state at all in fields of your controller. Maybe you should reconsider the need for a field in your controller. In fact there is a init method for spring beans. You can simply annotate a public void method on your controller with @PostConstruct . This method is executed after dependencies have been injected . Thus, this method is invoked exactly ones after the controller instance is created. As far as I understand your question you look for some method that is executed before every call to a method of your controller. In that case you could simply at a call to your ""init""-method in the beginning of each of your controller methods . If you dont want to do this explicit in your code AOP provide you an alternative.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3236971', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/196963/']}",jdg_328163

However, in a Django app, you can still use your own code to read or write to the database, in addition to using the ORM (e.g. through your Django model) And given that you most likely have data in the database previously written by pandas' to_sql , you can keep using the same database and the same pandas code and simply create a Django model that can access that table e.g. if your pandas code was writing to SQL table mytable , simply create a model like this: class MyModel(Model):    class Meta:        db_table = 'mytable' # This tells Django where the SQL table is        managed = False # Use this if table already exists                        # and doesn't need to be managed by Django    field_1 = ...    field_2 = ... Now you can use this model from Django simultaneously with your existing pandas code (possibly in a single Django app) Django database settings To get the same DB credentials into the pandas SQL functions simply read the fields from Django settings, e.g.: from django.conf import settingsuser = settings.DATABASES['default']['USER']password = settings.DATABASES['default']['PASSWORD']database_name = settings.DATABASES['default']['NAME']# host = settings.DATABASES['default']['HOST']# port = settings.DATABASES['default']['PORT']database_url = 'postgresql://{user}:{password}@localhost:5432/{database_name}'.format(    user=user,    password=password,    database_name=database_name,)engine = create_engine(database_url, echo=False) The alternative is not recommended as it's inefficient I don't really see a way beside reading the dataframe row by row and then creating a model instance, and saving it, which is really slow. You might get away with some batch insert operation, but why bother since pandas' to_sql already does that for us. And reading Django querysets into a pandas dataframe is just inefficient when pandas can do that faster for us too. # Doing it like this is slowfor index, row in df.iterrows():     model = MyModel()     model.field_1 = row['field_1']     model.save()",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/34425607', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2849004/']}",jdg_217523

Question:
I can't seem to find a way to use Caps Lock as the compose key properly. Some methods are not portable since they require that you detect the key number using something like xev on every host. Other methods result in a ~/.Xmodmap which cannot be passed to xmodmap more than once without bad keysym and similar errors. This makes it difficult to test changes to the file. Is there some way to do this in ~/.Xmodmap ?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You are having problems with idempotency because you are using keysym instead of keycode . Think of keycode as being an assignment of a key to a function, while keysym is just a link from a function name to an actual function. When you use keysym as follows: keysym Caps_Lock = Multi_key you essentially delete the name Caps_Lock . Therefore, the next time you run xmodmap and you reference Caps_Lock in this same line, it gets confused. The correct way to do it is to reassign the keycode directly as follows: keycode 66 = Multi_key You can get the keycode from the xev command for example.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/108207', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/3645/']}",jdg_125007

Question:
I am reading ""Linear Algebra Done Right 3rd Edition"" by Sheldon Axler. 6.A.17 Prove or disprove: there is an inner product on $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that the associated norm is given by $$||(x,y)||=\max\{x,y\}$$ for all $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ . I solved this exercise but I am worried if my solution is ok because this exercise appears to be unnaturally too easy. My solution is the following: If there is an inner product on $\mathbb{R}^2$ such that the associated norm is given by $$||(x,y)||=\max\{x,y\}$$ for all $(x,y)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ , then $0<||(-1,-1)||=\max\{-1,-1\}=-1$ . This is a contradiction.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As covered in the comments, you need absolute values to get what is called the $\infty$ -norm: $$\|(x, y)\|_{\infty} = \max\{|x|, |y|\}.$$ This is the limit as $p \to \infty$ of the $p$ -norm $$\|(x, y)\|_p = (|x|^p + |y|^p)^{1/p}$$ which generalizes the Euclidean norm ( $p = 2$ ). The rule for when a norm comes from an inner product is called the Parallelogram law which says that if $\| \cdot \|$ comes from an inner product, then for all $u, v$ $$\|u + v\|^2 + \|u - v\|^2 = 2(\|u\|^2 + \|v\|^2).$$ Moreover, if this identity holds for all $u$ and $v$ , the inner product is recovered "" by polarization "" as $$\langle u, v \rangle = \frac{\|u + v\|^2 - \|u - v\|^2}{4}.$$ So continuing with Axler's exercise, show that the $\infty$ -norm (with the absolute values) does not satisfy the Parallelogram law. Slightly more challenging: show that the Parallelogram law holds for all $u, v$ for the $p$ -norm if and only $p = 2$ .

Question:
I have put some cache cleaning code in onDestroy of my activity but most of the time the code is not executed unless I explicitly finish the activity via finish() . Edit: Just read onDestroy is called only with finish() or if the system is low on resources. So where do I need to put my cache cleaning code?

","From Android developer documentation : protected void onDestroy () Added in API level 1 Perform any final cleanup before an activity is  destroyed. This can happen either because the activity is finishing  (someone called finish() on it, or because the system is temporarily  destroying this instance of the activity to save space. You can  distinguish between these two scenarios with the isFinishing() method. Note: do not count on this method being called as a place for saving  data! For example, if an activity is editing data in a content  provider, those edits should be committed in either onPause() or  onSaveInstanceState(Bundle), not here. This method is usually  implemented to free resources like threads that are associated with an  activity, so that a destroyed activity does not leave such things  around while the rest of its application is still running. There are  situations where the system will simply kill the activity's hosting  process without calling this method (or any others) in it, so it  should not be used to do things that are intended to remain around  after the process goes away.

A note : for example, for those interested, one of the possible ways of calculating both series from UPDATE III and UPDATE IV is based on building a system of relations with the two series by exploiting $\displaystyle \int_0^1 x^{n-1} \log^2(1-x)\textrm{d}x=\frac{H_n^2+H_n^{(2)}}{n}$ and $\displaystyle \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x^n(H_n^2-H_n^{(2)})=\frac{\log^2(1-x)}{1-x}$ .Apart from this, the series from UPDATE III allows at least a (very) elegant approach by using different means. Using the first series we may obtain (based on the series representation of $\log(1-x)\log(1+x)$ and the integral $\int_0^1 x^{n-1}\operatorname{Li}_2(x)\textrm{d}x$ ) a way for proving that $$\int_0^1 \frac{\operatorname{Li}_2(x) \log (1+x) \log (1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x=\frac{29 }{64}\zeta (5)-\frac{5 }{8}\zeta (2) \zeta (3).$$ Then, based on the solution below and using the alternating harmonic series in the book, (Almost) Impossible Integrals, Sums, and Series , we have $$\int_0^1 \frac{\operatorname{Li}_2(-x) \log (1+x) \log (1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x$$ $$=\frac{5 }{16}\zeta (2) \zeta (3)+\frac{123 }{32}\zeta (5)+\frac{2}{3}  \log ^3(2)\zeta (2)-\frac{7}{4}  \log ^2(2)\zeta (3)-\frac{2}{15}\log ^5(2)\\-4 \log (2)\operatorname{Li}_4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)-4 \operatorname{Li}_5\left(\frac{1}{2}\right).$$ And if we add up the two previous integrals, we get $$\int_0^1 \frac{\operatorname{Li}_2(x^2) \log (1+x) \log (1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x$$ $$=\frac{275}{32}\zeta (5)-\frac{5 }{8}\zeta (2) \zeta (3)+\frac{4}{3}  \log ^3(2)\zeta (2)-\frac{7}{2}  \log ^2(2)\zeta (3)-\frac{4}{15}\log ^5(2)\\-8 \log (2)\operatorname{Li}_4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)-8 \operatorname{Li}_5\left(\frac{1}{2}\right).$$ Update (integrals): Another curious integral arising during the calculations $$\int_0^1 \frac{x \log (x) \log(1-x^2) \operatorname{Li}_2(x)}{1-x^2} \textrm{d}x=\frac{41 }{32}\zeta (2) \zeta (3)-\frac{269 }{128}\zeta (5).$$ QUESTION : Have these series ever been known in literature?

","Update: the paper mentioned below is the preprint On the calculation of two essential harmonic series with a weight $5$ structure, involving harmonic numbers of the type $H_{2n}$ by Cornel Ioan Valean A solution in large steps by Cornel Ioan Valean : Considering $\displaystyle -\log(1+y)\log(1-y)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} y^{2n} \frac{H_{2n}-H_n}{n}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}  \frac{y^{2n}}{n^2}$ where we divide both sides by $y$ and then integrate from $y=0$ to $y=x$ , we have $\displaystyle -\int_0^x \frac{\log(1+y)\log(1-y)}{y}\textrm{d}y=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x^{2n} \frac{H_{2n}-H_n}{2n^2}+\frac{1}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}  \frac{x^{2n}}{n^3}$ . Now, if we multiply both sides of this last result by $\log(1+x)/x$ and then integrate from $x=0$ to $x=1$ , using the fact that $\displaystyle \int_0^1 x^{2n-1}\log(1+x) \textrm{d}x=\frac{H_{2n}-H_n}{2n}$ , we get { A specific note : one can multiply both sides of the relation above by $\log(1-x)/x$ instead of $\log(1+x)/x$ and use the integral, $\int_0^1 x^{n-1}\log(1-x)\textrm{d}x=-H_n/n$ , but later in the process one might like to use though the version $\int_0^1 x^{2n-1}\log(1+x) \textrm{d}x$ to nicely get the calculations.} $$\underbrace{-\int_0^1 \frac{\log(1+x)}{x}\left(\int_0^x \frac{\log(1+y)\log(1-y)}{y}\textrm{d}y\right)\textrm{d}x}_{\displaystyle I}=\frac{5}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_n^2}{n^3}+\frac{7}{8}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_n}{n^4}-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\frac{H_{n}}{n^4}-\displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\frac{H_n^2}{n^3}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_nH_{2n}}{n^3}.$$ Integrating by parts, the integral $I$ may be written as $5/16\zeta(2)\zeta(3)-\underbrace{\int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2(-x) \log (1+x) \log (1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x}_{J}$ , and then we may write that $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_nH_{2n}}{n^3}=2\int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2(-x) \log (1+x) \log (1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x-\frac{5}{8}\zeta(2)\zeta(3)+\frac{5}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_n^2}{n^3}+\frac{7}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{H_n}{n^4}-2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\frac{H_{n}}{n^4}-2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}\frac{H_n^2}{n^3}\tag1 .$$ Now, the last magical part comes from considering expressing the integral $J$ in a different way, and by using the Cauchy product, $\displaystyle \operatorname{Li}_2(-x)\log(1+x)=3\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n \frac{x^n}{n^3}-2 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^n  x^n\frac{H_n}{n^2}-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^nx^n\frac{H_n^{(2)}}{n}$ , we get that $$\int_0^1 \frac{\operatorname{Li}_2(-x) \log (1+x) \log (1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x= -\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }(-1)^{n-1}\frac{ H_n H_n^{(2)}}{n^2}+3\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }(-1)^{n-1}\frac{ H_n}{n^4}\\-2\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }(-1)^{n-1}\frac{H_n^2}{n^3}.\tag2$$ Combining $(1)$ and $(2)$ and collecting the values of the series from the book, (Almost) Impossible Integrals, Sums, and Series , we are done with the first series. To get the value of the second series we might use the relation: \begin{equation*}\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{H_n H_{2 n}}{(2 n-1)^3}-\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{H_n H_{2 n}}{(2 n)^3}\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}=6 \log (2)-2 \log ^2(2)-\frac{1}{12}\log ^4(2)+\frac{3}{20} \log ^5(2)-\frac{3}{2} \zeta (2)-\frac{21}{8} \zeta (3)+\frac{173}{32} \zeta (4)\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}+\frac{55}{32} \zeta (5)-\frac{5 }{4}\zeta (2) \zeta (3)+\frac{3}{2} \log (2) \zeta (2)-\frac{7}{2}\log (2)\zeta (3)-4\log (2)\zeta (4)+\frac{1}{2} \log ^2(2) \zeta (2)\end{equation*} \begin{equation*}-\frac{5}{6}  \log ^3(2)\zeta (2)+\frac{21}{8}\log ^2(2)\zeta (3)-2 \operatorname{Li}_4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+4 \log (2)\operatorname{Li}_4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)+2 \operatorname{Li}_5\left(\frac{1}{2}\right),\end{equation*} and this is obtained by using a very similar strategy to the one given in Section 6.59 , pages $530$ - $532$ , from the book, (Almost) Impossible Integrals, Sums, and Series . The critical identity here is given in (6.289) . A detailed solution will appear soon in a new paper. UPDATE (September $30$ , $2019$ ) A magical way to the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H_{2n}H_n^{(2)}}{(2n)^2}$ by Cornel Ioan Valean By the Cauchy product, we have $\operatorname{Li}_2(x^2) \log(1-x^2)= 3\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{x^{2 n}}{n^3}-2\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } x^{2n}\frac{H_n}{n^2}-\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } x^{2n}\frac{H_n^{(2)}}{n}$ , and if we multiply both sides by $\log(1-x)/x$ , and integrate from $x=0$ to $x=1$ , using that $\int_0^1 x^{n-1}\log(1-x)\textrm{d}x=-H_n/n$ , and doing all the reductions, we arrive at $$2\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{H_{2 n} H_n^{(2)}}{(2 n)^2}-12\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{H_n}{n^4}+12\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }(-1)^{n-1} \frac{H_n}{n^4}+\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{H_n H_{2 n}}{n^3}$$ $$=\int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2\left(x^2\right) \log \left(1-x^2\right) \log (1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x$$ $$=\int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2\left(x^2\right) \log (1+x) \log (1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x+2 \int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2(-x) \log ^2(1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x\\+2 \int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2(x) \log ^2(1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x$$ $$=\int_0^1 \frac{\text{Li}_2\left(x^2\right) \log (1+x) \log (1-x)}{x} \textrm{d}x+2 \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{H_n^2}{n^3}-2 \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{(-1)^{n-1}H_n^2}{n^3}+2 \sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{H_n^{(2)}}{n^3}\\-2 \sum _{n=1}^{\infty }(-1)^{n-1} \frac{ H_n^{(2)}}{n^3},$$ where the last integral is given here Two very advanced harmonic series of weight $5$ , and all the last resulting harmonic series are given in the book (Almost) Impossible Integrals, Sums, and Series . The reduction to the last series has been achieved by using the identity, $\displaystyle \int_0^1 x^{n-1}\log^2(1-x)\textrm{d}x=\frac{H_n^2+H_n^{(2)}}{n}$ . The series $\sum _{n=1}^{\infty } \frac{H_n H_{2 n}}{n^3}$ maybe found calculated in the paper On the calculation of two essential harmonicseries with a weight 5 structure, involving harmonic numbers of the type H_{2n} by Cornel Ioan Valean .Thus, we have $$\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{H_{2n}H_n^{(2)}}{(2n)^2}=\frac{101}{64}\zeta(5)-\frac5{16}\zeta(2)\zeta(3).$$ All the details will appear in a new paper. UPDATE (October $30$ , $2019$ )The details with respect to the evaluation of the previous series may be found in the preprint The evaluation of a special harmonic series with a weight $5$ structure, involving harmonic numbers of the type $H_{2n}$ UPDATE (July $05$ , $2020$ )The two essential series stated above may be found now as an article here .

Question:
Wikipedia has the following definition of the pumping lemma for regular langauges... Let $L$ be a regular language. Then there exists an integer $p$ ≥ 1  depending only on $L$ such that every string $w$ in $L$ of length at  least $p$ ($p$ is called the ""pumping length"") can be written as $w$ =  $xyz$ (i.e., $w$ can be divided into three substrings), satisfying the  following conditions: |$y$| ≥ 1 |$xy$| ≤ $p$ for all $i$ ≥ 0, $xy^iz$ ∈ $L$ I do not see how this is satisfied for a simple finite regular language. If I have an alphabet of {$a,b$} and regular expression $ab$ then $L$ consists of just the one word which is $a$ followed by $b$. I now want to see if my regular language satisfies the pumping lemma... As nothing repeats in my regular expression the value of $y$ must be empty so that condition 3 is satisifed for all $i$. But if so then it fails condition 1 which says $y$ must be at least 1 in length! If instead I let $y$ be either $a$, $b$ or $ab$ then it will satisfy condition 1 but fail condition 3 because it never actually repeats itself. I am obviously missing something mind blowingly obvious. Which is?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You are right - we cannot allow ""pumping"" words of a finite $L$. The thing you are missing is that the lemma says there exists a number $p$, but does not tell us the number. All words longer than $p$ can be pumped, by the lemma. For a finite $L$, it happens so that $p$ is larger than the length of the longest word in $L$. Thus, the lemma only holds vacuously, and cannot be applied to any word in $L$, i.e., any word in $L$ does not satisfy the condition of ""having length at least $p$"" as the lemma requires. A corollary: if $L$ has pumping length $p$, and there exists some word $w\in L$ of length at least $p$, then $L$ is infinite.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/1847', 'https://cs.stackexchange.com', 'https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/1434/']}",jdg_174731

Question:
Let $G$ be a finite group acting linearly on $\mathbb C^n$, and suppose that $|G| < n^2$. I am trying to show that there is a nonzero invariant subspace $W\subset\mathbb C^n$, i.e. $g(w) \in W$ whenever $w\in W$. I know that if there is an $x\in \mathbb C^n$ with $\sum_{g\in G} g(x) \not=0$, then the linear span of $x$ is the desired subspace. However, I am not sure how to produce such an $x$ or if this is even the right way to go about the problem. Any suggestions?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It is an elementary property of finite groups that the sum of the squares of the dimensions of the irreducible representations is equal to the order of the group. (Consider decomposing the regular representation). Since here $|G| < n^2$, this representation certainly cannot be irreducible, so by definition there is an invariant subspace. (In fact, we see that the result holds for $|G| = n^2$ as well, as long as $n>1$, since there is always the trivial representation).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/271691', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/15464/']}",jdg_272866

","a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}; The command Partition[a, 2] just partitions the input into as many nonoverlapping pairs as possible: {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8}} The three-argument version creates pairs with an offset of `1: Partition[a, 2, 1] {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {4, 5}, {5, 6}, {6, 7}, {7, 8}, {8, 9}} That is already very close to what you want!

Question:
We can modify a DOM element and add to its prototype. For example, if we want to add something only to the canvas, we'd do something like this: HTMLCanvasElement.prototype.doSomething = function(arg) { ... }; We can then perform this action on a canvas element: var canvas = document.getElementById('canvasId');canvas.doSomething(...); Is it possible to add/attach a function to this instance of the canvas without modifying the prototype of HTMLCanvasElement. I only want a canvas where doSomething(...) was called to have access to the additional methods, not all canvas elements in the DOM. How can I do this? I've tried the following in my doSomething function: this.prototype.foobar = function() {...} However, prototype is undefined here.

Question:
I am working on my first app and within it I'm just trying to have on button click show a map with a pin (and title on this pin of location). I was able to load the mapview and to have it show the coordinates I want. But when trying to display the pin and annotation I am having issues. Not sure where to code this and how to make annotation to display pin. I've searched and seen many tutorials, but most show a different mapview style and are showing pin on user selection, I want to show pin on load of map.

Question:
Special means that they give you functionality which is impossible to get otherwise, so they treat by compiler in special way.Examples: 'DelayedInit' - convert all init code to main methods, 'Dynamic' - proxy of all methods etc

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","At present, the only special traits I'm aware of are DelayedInit and Dynamic . Anything inheriting from these traits also gets special treatment by the compiler, as with App , which subclasses DelayedInit . It's worth noting that any trait could potentially be used as a marker by some library, framework, or compiler plugin to ""give you functionality which is impossible to get otherwise"".  These two are the only traits that are specially recognized by the default compiler though. As well as marker traits, there are some annotations that get treated specially, the scala.annotation and scala.reflect are good places to find these, there's also the @specialized annotation in the scala package and several in compiler plugins (such as delimited continuations).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/7253757', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/426377/']}",jdg_360100

Question:
I have a simple python/flask app. It's like this on the container /var/www/app/  appl/    static/      ...    app.py  wsgi.py I used to let the nginx serve the static files directly before using docker.

I can think of 2 possible solutions: start a nginx inside the container as before, and let the host nginx to communicate with the container nginx using port like 8000 mount the (host)/var/www/www.domain.com/static to (container)/var/www/static and copy all static files in run.sh What do the docker prefer?

Question:
Lets say I have guessed a lottery number of: 1689 And the way the lottery works is, the order of the digits don't matter as long as the digits match up 1:1 with the digits in the actual winning lottery number. So, the number 1689 would be a winning lottery number with: 1896, 1698, 9816, etc.. As long as each digit in your guess was present in the target number, then you win the lottery. Is there a mathematical way I can do this? I've solved this problem with a O(N^2) looping checking each digit against each digit of the winning lottery number (separating them with modulus).  Which is fine, it works but I want to know if there are any neat math tricks I can do. For example, at first... I thought I could be tricky and just take the sum and product of each digit in both numbers and if they matched then you won. ^ Do you think that would work? However, I quickly disproved this when I found that lottery guess: 222, and 124 have the different digits but the same product and sum. Anyone know any math tricks I can use to quickly determine if the digits in num1 match the digits in num2 regardless of order?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","How about going through each number, and counting up the number of appearances of each digit (into two different 10 element arrays)?  After you'd done the totaling, compare the counts of each digit.  Since you only look at each digit once, that's O(N). Code would look something like: for(int i=0; i<digit_count; i++){   guessCounts[guessDigits[i] - '0']++;   actualCounts[actualDigits[i] - '0']++;}bool winner = true;for(int i=0; i<10 && winner; i++){   winner &= guessCounts[i] == actualCounts[i];} Above code makes the assumption that guessDigits and actualDigits are both char strings; if they held the actual digits then you can just skip the - '0' business. There are probably optimizations that would make this take less space or terminate sooner, but it's a pretty straightforward example of an O(N) approach. By the way, as I mentioned in a comment, the multiplication/sum comparison will definitely not work because of zeros.  Consider 0123 and 0222.  Product is 0, sum is 6 in both cases.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/567165', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/64878/']}",jdg_167820

Question:
While browsing around about problems similar to the problem of Apollonius , I have found references to constructions of all types of circles. For example, not only is it possible to construct a circle tangent to three given circles, but one can construct a circle through any three points, tangent to any three lines, passing through two given points and tangent to a line or circle, passing through a given point and tangent to two given lines or circles, etc. Pretty much any combination of criteria regarding points, lines, and circles, with repetition. Can we have one of each? I haven't found any resource saying whether it's possible or not to construct a circle through a given point, tangent to a given line, and tangent to a given circle. Is such a construction possible? Thanks.

","It is possible, provided that the point and at least part of the circle are on the same side of the line and the circle does not separate the point from the line.   If the point and the circle are on opposite sides of the line, or if the point is inside the circle and the line wholly outside, then it is impossible (as it is with three nested circles in the original version).

Below is the code which I use to make single post request to the web server over http , but whenever I replace the http with https (Self Signed) I get an error: HandshakeException: Handshake error in client (OS Error:  CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED: self signed certificate(handshake.cc:355)) var url = 'http://192.168.1.40/registration.php'; //or https var data = {""email"":""yyyy@xx.com"",""name"":""xyz""}; http.post(url, body:data)     .then((response) {   print(""Response status: ${response.statusCode}"");   print(""Response body: ${response.body}""); }).catchError((error) => print(error.toString())); I am pretty new to Flutter and Dart please help me out. Suggestions will be welcomed.

","http.post is a convenience wrapper which creates a IOClient under the hood. You can pass your own io HttpClient to this, and that has a way to disable the certificate checks, so you just have to construct them yourself like this... bool trustSelfSigned = true;  HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient()    ..badCertificateCallback =        ((X509Certificate cert, String host, int port) => trustSelfSigned);  IOClient ioClient = new IOClient(httpClient);  ioClient.post(url, body:data);  // don't forget to call ioClient.close() when done  // note, this also closes the underlying HttpClient the bool trustSelfSigned controls whether you get the default behaviour or allows bad certificates.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/49839729', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2895301/']}",jdg_256620

Question:
It might be just a simple definition problem but I learned in class that a central force does not necessarily need to be conservative and the German Wikipedia says so too. However, the English Wikipedia states different on their articles for example: A central force is a conservative field, that is, it can always be expressed as the negative gradient of a potential They use the argument that each central force can be expressed as a gradient of a (radial symmetric) potential. And since forces that are gradient fields are per definition conservative forces, central forces must be conservative. As far as I understand, a central force can have a (radial symmetric) potential but this is not necessarily always the case. Update Sep 2017: The english Wikipedia has updated its text and now explicitly states Not all central force fields are conservative nor spherically symmetric. However, it can be shown that a central force is conservative if and only if it is spherically symmetric.[2]

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Depends on what you mean by 'central force'. If your central force is of the form ${\vec F} = f(r){\hat r}$ (the force points radially inward/outward and its magnitude depends only on the distance from the center), then it is easy to show that $\phi = - \int dr f(r)$ is a potential field for the force and generates the force.  This is usually what I see people mean when they say ""central force."" If, however, you just mean that the force points radially inward/outward, but can depend on the other coordinates, then you have ${\vec F} = f(r,\theta,\phi){\hat r}$ , and you're going to run into problems finding the potential, because you need $f = - \frac{\partial V}{\partial r}$ , but you will also need to have $\frac{\partial V}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi} = 0$ to kill the non-radial components, and this will lead to contradictions. It's logical that a field of this form is going to be nonconservative, because if the force is greater at $\theta = 0$ than it is at $\theta = \pi/2$ , then you can do net work around a closed curve by moving outward from $r_{1}$ to $r_{2}$ at $\theta = 0$ (positive work), then staying at $r_{2}$ constant, going from $\theta =0 $ to $\theta = \pi/2$ (zero work--radial force), going back to $r_{1}$ (less work than the first step), and returning to $\theta = 0$ (zero work).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/38874', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/8117/']}",jdg_72763

Question:
My question is about Linux in general but lets suppose my ubuntu isn't working property, booting in tty or whatever. I have no internet connection but I have ubuntu live cd. Is it possible to reinstall the desktop environment from live cd?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Yes it is. Either by using the CD as a repository, or by booting into the live session and downloading the package manually and then installing from your normal OS or even by setting up a chroot environment. IN the examples below, I am using apt-get xfce as the command you will want to run but dpkg-reconfigure or whatever else would work as well. 1. Use the CD as a repository. Say that you've screwed up your desktop and are booting to a command line with no internet access (which shouldn't happen, you can have internet even without a GUI). OK, you can put your CD in your drive and then run sudo apt-cdrom If all goes well, that should detect your CD, mount it and parse it for packages. Once that's done, run sudo apt-get update to refresh your sources and install your desktop normally. For example: apt-get install xfce4-desktop . NOTE: I have not tested this but it is relatively well documented. See, for example, here . 2. Boot into the live session and get the packages you want. This one requires that you actually have a working internet connection in the live CD environment. First, boot into your normal (broken) OS and install apt-offline . If your system is already broken, you can download the package here (make sure you also get the dependencies) and install with sudo dpkg -i apt-offline_1.3.1_all.deb Once you have it installed run sudo apt-offline set xfce-offline.sig --install-packages xfce4 Then, take the file that was just generated ( xfce-offline.sig ), boot into the live session and run sudo apt-offline get xfce-offline.sig --no-checksum --bundle xfce-offline.zip Now, boot back into your local system to install it: unzip  xfce-offline.zip That should result in a list of .deb files that you can then install manually. I also found something called keryx which might be worth checking out: Keryx is a free, open source application for updating Linux. The Keryx Project started as a way for users with dialup, or low-bandwidth internet to be able to download and update packages on their debian based distribution of linux. Mainly built for Ubuntu, Keryx allows users to select packages to install, check for updates, and download these packages onto a USB portable storage device. The packages are saved onto the device and are then taken back to the Linux box that it originated from and are then installed. Finally, you can also do all this manually with apt-get from the live session: sudo apt-get update --print-uris -y | sed ""s/'//g"" | cut -d ' ' -f 1,2 |   while read url target; do wget $url -O ./$target; done The command above will download all .deb files needed to install xfce . See my answer here for more details on how that works.

Use the live CD to set up a chroot environment. Setting up the chroot is explained in more detail here but the basic procedure is (replace /dev/sda1 with whichever partition has your / ): sudo mkdir /mnt/foosudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/foosudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/foo/dev && sudo mount --bind /dev/pts /mnt/foo/dev/pts && sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/foo/proc && sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/foo/syssudo chroot /mnt/foo You have now tricked your system into thinking it is booted into your installed OS and you can use apt-get normally.

","You can think of the Kernel Density Estimation as a smoothed histogram. Histograms are limited by the fact that they are inherently discrete (via bins) and are thus more appropriate for displaying data on discrete variables and can be very sensitive to bin size. What you are actually doing with the Kernel Density Estimation is estimating the probability density function. This makes the interpretation straightforward. So the area under the curve is 1, and the probability of a value being between x1 and x2 is the area under the curve between those two points. The number of Y values will determine the ""resolution"" of the curve, so if you assume a straight line between every two adjacent Y points you can calculate an approximation of the area under the curve between those two points.

Question:
I have a question. How come that the flight from Toronto to Moscow takes the same time as the flight from Moscow to Toronto. Should it take much longer because of the earth rotation? One direction we travel in direction or an orbit and traveling back we are going against the Earth orbit... From Toronto 9hoursFrom Moscow 9:45 hours. If flying from Moscow we are traveling against the Earth rotation so we should add half of the travel to our current travel. It means that the travel from Moscow should take about 13 hours... Thanks,

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The reason flights take a different amount of time, depending on the direction is prevailing winds, not the earths rotation. This is because the atmosphere rotates with the earth, and the plane has a constant airspeed traveling both ways. However due to the coriolis effect the prevailing winds have a constant eastwards or westwards direction (as explained in this wikipedia article ), making the ground speed (airspeed + wind speed) different in both directions. The effect the earth's daily rotation is on the weight of the airplane due to the centrifugal force (which exists in our frame of reference). This effect is very small and doesn't impact the speed of flight Ok, back to Toronto-Moscow. As you can see in this map the flight path goes northwards over greenland and closer then normally to the north pole. Image source This means that the prevailing winds blow more perpendicularly (east or west) to the planes movements, thus having a smaller impact on the flight duration. To test this theory I looked up flights between Moscow and Dubai, as they are almost perfectly north/south of each other. And the flight time difference is only 10 mins!

Question:
In terms of space-time complexity which of the following is best way to iterate over a std::vector and why? Way 1: for(std::vector<T>::iterator it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {    /* std::cout << *it; ... */} Way 2: for(std::vector<int>::size_type i = 0; i != v.size(); i++) {    /* std::cout << v[i]; ... */} Way 3: for(size_t i = 0; i != v.size(); i++) {    /* std::cout << v[i]; ... */} Way 4: for(auto const& value: a) {     /* std::cout << value; ... */

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","First of all, Way 2 and Way 3 are identical in practically all standard library implementations. Apart from that, the options you posted are almost equivalent. The only notable difference is that in Way 1 and Way 2/3 , you rely on the compiler to optimize the call to v.end() and v.size() out. If that assumption is correct, there is no performance difference between the loops. If it's not, Way 4 is the most efficient. Recall how a range based for loop expands to {   auto && __range = range_expression ;   auto __begin = begin_expr ;   auto __end = end_expr ;   for ( ; __begin != __end; ++__begin) {      range_declaration = *__begin;      loop_statement   }} The important part here is that this guarantees the end_expr to be evaluated only once. Also note that for the range based for loop to be the most efficient iteration, you must not change how the dereferencing of the iterator is handled, e.g. for (auto value: a) { /* ... */ } this copies each element of the vector into the loop variable value , which is likely to be slower than for (const auto& value : a) , depending on the size of the elements in the vector. Note that with the parallel algorithm facilities in C++17, you can also try out #include <algorithm>#include <execution>std::for_each(std::par_unseq, a.cbegin(), a.cend(),   [](const auto& e) { /* do stuff... */ }); but whether this is faster than an ordinary loop depends on may circumstantial details.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/55606153', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/500590/']}",jdg_305687

Question:
What is the difference between decimal , float and double in .NET? When would someone use one of these?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","float (the C# alias for System.Single ) and double (the C# alias for System.Double ) are floating binary point types . float is 32-bit; double is 64-bit. In other words, they represent a number like this: 10001.10010110011 The binary number and the location of the binary point are both encoded within the value. decimal (the C# alias for System.Decimal ) is a floating decimal point type . In other words, they represent a number like this: 12345.65789 Again, the number and the location of the decimal point are both encoded within the value – that's what makes decimal still a floating point type instead of a fixed point type. The important thing to note is that humans are used to representing non-integers in a decimal form, and expect exact results in decimal representations; not all decimal numbers are exactly representable in binary floating point – 0.1, for example – so if you use a binary floating point value you'll actually get an approximation to 0.1. You'll still get approximations when using a floating decimal point as well – the result of dividing 1 by 3 can't be exactly represented, for example. As for what to use when: For values which are ""naturally exact decimals"" it's good to use decimal . This is usually suitable for any concepts invented by humans: financial values are the most obvious example, but there are others too. Consider the score given to divers or ice skaters, for example. For values which are more artefacts of nature which can't really be measured exactly anyway, float / double are more appropriate. For example, scientific data would usually be represented in this form. Here, the original values won't be ""decimally accurate"" to start with, so it's not important for the expected results to maintain the ""decimal accuracy"". Floating binary point types are much faster to work with than decimals.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 12, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/618535', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/-1/']}",jdg_122553

","Doing this is astoundingly convoluted. You can see my solution in action here : the methodology is described below (getting the HTML elements, by ID or otherwise, is left as an exercise for the reader). In the HTML Make sure your SVG element includes the attribute xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"" , as you're going to need to take the source of the element as its own file, and the XMLNS declaration is required for standalone SVG files. (Also note that this means your SVG will need to be self-contained and can't refer to elements in its parent document with something like <use> .) Optionally, wrap the element in a <div> or <span> , which you may use to get the content of the <svg> element using .innerHTML . (Neither the innerHTML nor the outerHTML attributes are present on SVG elements in the current HTML standard.) Include a <link rel=""icon""> in your page's <head> . In JavaScript Get the source of the SVG element you want to set as your favicon by getting the innerHTML attribute of the HTML element you've wrapped it in, or by calling new XMLSerializer().serializeToString() on the SVG element. Create a DataURL for this element as a document by prepending the string ""data:image/svg+xml,"" to the source. (If most browsers supported SVGs for favicons, we'd be done here, but since, at time of writing, they don't, we must go deeper .) Create an <img> element that you'll be routing the image through, add an event listener to it for the load event that will draw the image once control returns to the event loop (as spec-compliant browsers won't let you read the image synchronously - see this crbug ), and set the DataURL of your SVG source as its src attribute. (The steps between this and step 8 can happen either in sync now, or as part of the listener callback; they just need to happen before you draw the image.) Decide what resolution you want to render your favicon to - My examples will use 64x64, for compatibility with high-DPI (Retina and Super Retina) displays. Create a <canvas> element (heretofore referred to as canvasElement ) and set its dimensions (by setting canvasElement.width = 64 and canvasElement.height = 64 ). Create a drawing context for the canvas using canvasElement.getContext('2d') (heretofore referred to as ctx ). If you're re-using a canvas you've created beforehand, set ctx.globalCompositeOperation = ""copy"" , or clear it with ctx.clearRect(0, 0, 64, 64) . Somewhere in the execution sequence following from the load listener you added to the <img> element you created in step 3, draw the image onto the canvas using ctx.drawImage(svgImg, 0, 0, 64, 64) (where svgImg is the <img> element you set the src to the SVG DataURL). Create a PNG DataURL from the canvas using canvasElement.toDataURL() , and set that to the href attribute of the <link rel=""icon""> element in your HTML.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/20232991', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2933643/']}",jdg_78762

Question:
Given two simple, closed, convex, planar curves $C_1$ and $C_2$ , let their lengths be $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ , respectively, and their Fréchet distance be $d_f$ . We are trying to bound $|\ell_1 - \ell_2|$ , their difference in length. Our current conjecture is that $|\ell_1 - \ell_2| \leq 2\pi d_f$ , but we are unable to find anything in the literature about it. Any help regarding a proof would be appreciated. Note that since both $C_1$ and $C_2$ are convex, the Fréchet distance between them is the same as the Hausdorff distance according to this paper . As a special case, if $C_2$ is a parallel curve of $C_1$ with distance $d_p$ , $|\ell_1 - \ell_2| = 2\pi d_p$ by this paper . Since both curves are simple, closed, and convex, the Fréchet distance $d_f = d_p$ (this is easily provable). Thus, this special case would reach the upper bound of our conjecture.

","As Leo Moos suggested in the comments, in any dimension $d$ , this is a simple consequence of the implicit function theorem. The implicit function theorem implies that every point $x\in\phi^{-1}(0)$ has a neighborhood $\Omega_x$ that is a diffeomorphic image $\varphi_x(Q_{\delta_x})$ of a box $Q_{\delta_x}=\{|y_i|\leq\delta_x,\;1\leq i \leq d\}$ , such that $\phi(\varphi(y))=|\nabla \phi(x)|\cdot y_1$ , and such that $\varphi_x(0)=x$ and $D\varphi_x(0)$ is a rotation. (Details: assume wlog that $x=0$ , and, by rotating, that $\nabla \phi (0)/|\nabla \phi (0)|=e_1,$ the first basis vector. Consider the function $g:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}^d$ defined by $g(x)=(\phi(x)/|\nabla \phi (0)|,x_2,\dots,x_d)$ . Then $Dg(0)$ is the identity, and $\varphi_x$ is the inverse $g^{-1}$ provided by the inverse function theorem.) Given $\varepsilon>0$ , by choosing smaller $\delta_x$ if necessary, we can ensure that the restriction of $\varphi_x$ to the leaves $\{y_1=h\}$ distorts the $(d-1)$ -area by no more than $1+\varepsilon$ , i. e., in $Q_{\delta_x}$ , $$1-\varepsilon<\left(\det_{2\leq i,j\leq d}\left(\partial_{y_i}\varphi\cdot\partial_{y_j}\varphi\right)\right)^\frac12\leq 1+\varepsilon.$$ By compactness, we can choose a finite cover $\Omega_i=\Omega_{x_i}$ , $i=1,\dots,n$ of $\phi^{-1}(0)$ . Then, for $\epsilon_0>0$ small enough, we have $W_{\epsilon_0}:=\{x:|\phi(x)|\leq\epsilon_0\}\subset \cup_{i=1}^n\Omega_i$ . Put $\Omega_0=\Omega\setminus W_{\epsilon_0}$ , then $\Omega_0,\Omega_1,\dots,\Omega_n$ is a finite cover of $\Omega$ , and we can pick a partition of unity $f_0,\dots,f_n$ subordinate to that cover. We have for $|h|<\epsilon_0$ , $$\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\phi^{-1}(h))=\sum_{i=1}^n\int f_i d\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\phi^{-1}(h)),$$ hence, by changing the variable, $$(1-\varepsilon)\sum_{i=1}^n\int_{y_1=h} f_i\circ\varphi_i\leq \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\phi^{-1}(h))\leq (1+\varepsilon)\sum_{i=1}^n\int_{y_1=h} f_i\circ\varphi_i.$$ As $h\to 0$ , the terms in the right-hand side tend to $$(1+\varepsilon)\int_{y_1=0}f_i\circ\varphi_i\leq (1+\varepsilon)^2\int f_i d\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\phi^{-1}(0)),$$ and similarly for the LHS. This means that $$(1-\varepsilon)^2\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\phi^{-1}(0))\leq\liminf_{h\to 0} \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\phi^{-1}(h)),$$ $$\limsup_{h\to 0} \mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\phi^{-1}(h))\leq (1+\varepsilon)^2\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\phi^{-1}(0)),$$ and since $\varepsilon>0$ is arbitrary, we are done.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/398178', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/322069/']}",jdg_251436

Question:
I'm using tqdm in Python to display console-progressbars in our scripts.However, I have to call functions which print messages to the console as well and which I can't change.In general, writing to the console while displaying progress bars in the console messes up the display like so: from time import sleepfrom tqdm import tqdmdef blabla():  print ""Foo blabla""for k in tqdm(range(3)):  blabla()  sleep(.5) This creates the output: 0%|                                           | 0/3 [00:00<?, ?it/s]Fooblabla33%|###########6                       | 1/3 [00:00<00:01,  2.00it/s]Fooblabla67%|#######################3           | 2/3 [00:01<00:00,  2.00it/s]Fooblabla100%|###################################| 3/3 [00:01<00:00,  2.00it/s] According to the documentation of tqdm the method tqdm.write() provides a means to write messages to the console without breaking the displayed progressbars.Thus, the right output is provided by this snippet: from time import sleepfrom tqdm import tqdmdef blabla():  tqdm.write(""Foo blabla"")for k in tqdm(range(3)):  blabla()  sleep(.5) And looks like this: Foo blablaFoo blablaFoo blabla100%|###################################| 3/3 [00:01<00:00,  1.99it/s] On the other hand, there is this solution which permits to silence those functions by quite elegantly redirecting sys.stdout into the void.This works perfectly well for silencing the functions. Since I want to display the messages from these functions nonetheless without breaking the progress bars, I tried to merge both solutions into one by redirecting sys.stdout to tqdm.write() and, in turn, letting tqdm.write() write to the old sys.stdout .This results in the snippet: from time import sleepimport contextlibimport sysfrom tqdm import tqdmclass DummyFile(object):  file = None  def __init__(self, file):    self.file = file  def write(self, x):    tqdm.write(x, file=self.file)@contextlib.contextmanagerdef nostdout():    save_stdout = sys.stdout    sys.stdout = DummyFile(save_stdout)    yield    sys.stdout = save_stdoutdef blabla():  print ""Foo blabla""for k in tqdm(range(3)):  with nostdout():    blabla()    sleep(.5) However, this actually creates an even more messed up output as before: 0%|                                           | 0/3 [00:00<?, ?it/s]Fooblabla33%|###########6                       | 1/3 [00:00<00:01,  2.00it/s]Fooblabla67%|#######################3           | 2/3 [00:01<00:00,  2.00it/s]Fooblabla100%|###################################| 3/3 [00:01<00:00,  2.00it/s] FYI: calling tqdm.write(..., end="""") inside DummyFile.write() creates the same result as the first output which is still messed up. I can't understand why this wouldn't work, since tqdm.write() is supposed to manage clearing the progress bar before writing the message and then rewriting the progress bar. What am I missing?

","Redirecting sys.stdout is always tricky, and it becomes a nightmare when two applications are twiddling with it at the same time. Here the trick is that tqdm by default prints to sys.stderr , not sys.stdout . Normally, tqdm has an anti-mixup strategy for these two special channels, but since you are redirecting sys.stdout , tqdm gets confused because the file handle changes. Thus, you just need to explicitly specify file=sys.stdout to tqdm and it will work: from time import sleepimport contextlibimport sysfrom tqdm import tqdmclass DummyFile(object):  file = None  def __init__(self, file):    self.file = file  def write(self, x):    # Avoid print() second call (useless \n)    if len(x.rstrip()) > 0:        tqdm.write(x, file=self.file)@contextlib.contextmanagerdef nostdout():    save_stdout = sys.stdout    sys.stdout = DummyFile(sys.stdout)    yield    sys.stdout = save_stdoutdef blabla():  print(""Foo blabla"")# tqdm call to sys.stdout must be done BEFORE stdout redirection# and you need to specify sys.stdout, not sys.stderr (default)for _ in tqdm(range(3), file=sys.stdout):    with nostdout():        blabla()        sleep(.5)print('Done!') I also added a few more tricks to make the output nicer (eg, no useless \n when using print() without end='' ). /EDIT: in fact it seems you can do the stdout redirection after starting tqdm , you just need to specify dynamic_ncols=True in tqdm .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/36986929', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3434933/']}",jdg_302916

Question:
I'm going to take an example of a simple common emitter amplifier . Forget about biasing and things for now, but focus on the crux of this circuit. As how I understand it, a voltage between the base node and the emitter node is varied which is ultimately amplified by the transistor, causing an inverted (amplified version) of the original signal to appear at the collector node. Right now, I'm working through a book; Sedra/Smith, Microelectronics. Throughout the chapter I'm working through, it says that in the active region, Vbe is assumed to be 0.7V . This just does not make sense to me, how can Vbe stay constant when that itself is the input variable for an amplifier stage? This might have started to make sense to me if I was looking at at a CE stage with an emitter resistor (emitter degeneration), where the remaining voltage could be dropped across the resistor. But this is not the case, so enlighten me! simulate this circuit – Schematic created using CircuitLab

Question:
There is a $q$ -binomial identity that I encountered in one paper I am reading ( https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.06193 ) which probably admits a very simple proof that I do not see: for two nonnegative integers $a,b$ , we have $$q^{ab}=\sum_{k\ge 0}(-1)^kq^{\binom{k}2}\binom{a}{k}_q\binom{b}{k}_q(q;q)_k, $$ where $(q;q)_k=(1-q)(1-q^2)\cdots(1-q^k)$ , $\binom{n}{k}_q=\frac{(q;q)_n}{(q;q)_k(q;q)_{n-k}}$ for $0\le k\le n$ and $\binom{n}{k}_q=0$ for $k>n$ . I am sure that this can be proved by a version of the A=B method, but for connecting this to my work not the identity as such but rather a conceptual proof or including it into some context is desirable. Since it is not an identity ""with positive coefficients"", it is not obvious if I should ask for a combinatorial interpretation, or some sort of Euler characteristic result, so I will just leave it slightly open-ended: have you seen any version of this identity?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Note that it will be enough to check the identity when $q$ is a prime power, in which case we can choose a field $F$ with $|F|=q$ , and vector spaces $A$ and $B$ of dimension $a$ and $b$ over $F$ .  In this context it is more natural to consider the function $\pi_q(k)=\prod_{i=1}^k(q^i-1)=(-1)^k(q;q)_k$ rather than $(q;q)_k$ , because $\pi_q(k)$ is a positive integer and is more closely related to counting problems.  We then have $$ {\binom{n}{k}_q}=\frac{\pi_q(n)}{\pi_q(k)\pi_q(n-k)} $$ and the stated identity becomes $$ q^{ab} = \sum_{k\geq 0} q^{\binom{k}{2}}\binom{a}{k}_q\binom{b}{k}_q\pi_q(k). $$ The left hand side is $|\text{Hom}(A,B)|$ .

The number of choices for $U$ is $\binom{a}{a-k}_q=\binom{a}{k}_q$ .  The number of choices for $V$ is $\binom{b}{k}_q$ .

Question:
I know that there are no blob urls only objects. I made my own blob object for a video buffer and then I used it in a src of video tag which is something like blob://website.com/blablobbla . I opened this url in the browser it worked when I opened the url of youtube video src (blob url) into a new tab it did't work but mine video src (blob url) worked I want to know how can I do the same with my blob urls so that they only work in the src of the html video tag and give error or don't work in the external tab/window of the browsers.I just want to know the technology behind this and blob objects and their url properties.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The question seems somewhat vague to me, so here is what I interpret (also from the code in the fiddle-images in your question): you receive a Blob (image's binary data) through a XMLHttpRequest() GET -request ( responseType = 'blob' ) you create a Blob URL with URL.createObjectURL() in the URL Store for XMLHttpRequest() response -object (the Blob holding the binary data) you set the resulting Blob URL -string as src for a image (and append the image to the document, thereby showing the image you just downloaded) You ""don't want it to work in new tab"" (""it"" being the Blob URL -string I assume). In your comments you say: In fiddle I inspected the image and copied the src and then pasted it in new tab and it worked and showed the image I don't want the image to be shown directly with the blob url. If you go to youtube and open the src of video in new tab : It will not work,, I want this to happen It appears to me that you do not want the user to be able to view/download the blob when they copy the Blob URL -string (by examining the live source or simply right-click-on-image>>Copy Imagelocation ) and paste it into a new tab/window (for which you give youtube as an example). But you are also talking about video's. TL;DR: It seems your question/bounty might be mixing up 2 different types of URL returned by window.URL.createObjectURL(); : Blob URL referencing (objects that represent) 'raw local data' (like (Local-)File, Blob, etc.) For these you want to automatically (or programmatically) revoke the Blob URL from the browser's URL Store (which you could consider a simplified local webserver inside the browser, only available to that browser). var myBlobURL=window.URL.createObjectURL(object , flag_oneTimeOnly ); returns a re-usable Blob URL which can be revoked with: window.URL.revokeObjectURL(myBlobURL) (adds the Blob URL string to the Revocation List ). Note: there used to be a second argument flag_oneTimeOnly which used to revoke the Blob URL automatically after it's first use, but that is currently no longer part of the spec! Also this flag often didn't work anyway (at least in firefox). var myBlobURL=window.URL.createFor(object); returns a Blob URL that is automatically revoked after it's first use . Note: quite some browsers were 'late' to implement this one. MediaSource object URL referencing a special MediaSource Object These URL's are only intended to link src of a HTMLMediaElement (think <audo> & <video> elements) to the special MediaSource Object Note: a new tab/window is not an HTMLMediaElement already automatically revoked Note: even though they are created through window.URL.createObjectURL(); Here's what's happening for the fiddle in your question's image and similar code that downloaded a video as Blob (where you downloaded the whole video-file's data/binary on the server using an xhr) or any other 'local' data: You are essentially using the 'bare' 'un-enhanced' File-API . The URL Store is only maintained during a session (so it will survive a page-refresh, since it is still the same session) and lost when the document is unloaded. So, if your fiddle is still open, then fiddle-document (the document that created the Blob URL ) is obviously not yet unloaded, and therefore it's Blob URL s are available to the browser (any tab/window) as long as it is not revoked! This is a relevant feature : you can build/download/modify a Blob in the browser, create a Blob URL and set it as href to a file-download link (which the user can right-click and open in a new tab/window!!) Close the fiddle or revoke the Blob URL from the URL Store and the Blob URL is no longer accessible (also not in a different tab/window). Try yourself with your modified fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/7cyoozwv/ In this fiddle it should now no longer be possible to load your sample image into a different tab/window after you copied the image url (once the image is displayed in your page). Here I revoked the URL manually ( revokeObjectURL() ) as it is currently the best cross-browser method (partially due to the api not yet fully being stabilized). Also note: an element's onload event can be an elegant place to revoke your Blob URL . Here is what's happening to an <audio> or <video> source linked to an MediaSource Object using an MediaSource object URL returned by window.URL.createObjectURL(MediaSource) : The Media Source Extensions (MSE) also extend the File-API 's window.URL.createObjectURL() to accept a MediaSource Object . The (current draft of the) URL Object Extension specifies that: This algorithm is intended to mirror the behavior of the createObjectURL()[FILE-API] method with autoRevoke set to true. Note that the current spec of the File API 's window.URL.createObjectURL() no longer has an autoRevoke (or flag_oneTimeOnly ) boolean flag accessible to the programmer who should be using window.URL.createFor() for this purpose instead. I wonder when the Media-Source spec will mimic that (and for backward compatibility alias their createObjectURL() to a new createFor() extension (seems more appropriate as that is how it seems to be intended to work currently)). These resulting automatically revoked URL-strings are only intended to link the src of a HTMLMediaElement (think <audo> & <video> elements) to the special MediaSource Object . I don't think that an empty Document (from a new tab/window) is a <audo> or <video> element. Perhaps ""A quick tutorial on MSE"" (source: MSDN ) might help clarify the difference and basic use: To use the MSE API, follow these steps: Define an HTML5 video element in the HTML section of a page. Create a MediaSource object in JavaScript. Create a virtual URL using createObjectURL with the MediaSource object as the source. Assign the virtual URL to the video element's src property. Create a SourceBuffer using addSourceBuffer , with the mime type of the video you're adding. Get the video initialization segment from the media file online and add it to the SourceBuffer with appendBuffer . Get the segments of video data from the media file, append them to the SourceBuffer with appendBuffer . Call the play method on the video element. Repeat step 7 until done. Clean up. You (or a big-time player like youtube who will dynamically select supported technologies for playback on the client's platform (so there is no way to tell for sure what kind of youtube video URL's you are talking about)) could be using the new special MediaSource Object to play video's (or audio). This adds buffer-based source options to HTML5 video for streaming support (compared to to downloading a complete video file before playing or use an add-on like Silverlight or Adobe Flash to stream media). Hope this is what you were after!",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/31102512', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3343503/']}",jdg_88386

Question:
Quoting from the C-std section 6.7.2.1, struct s { int n; double d[]; }; This is a valid structure declaration. I am looking for some practical use of this kind of syntax. To be precise, how is this construct any more or less powerful than keeping a double* as the 2nd element? Or is this another case of 'you-can-do-it-in-multiple-ways'? Arpan

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The C FAQ answers precisely this question.  The quick answer is that this structure will include the double array inside the structure rather than a pointer to an array outside the structure.  As a quick example, you could use your structure as in this example: struct s mystruct = malloc(sizeof(struct s) + 5 * sizeof(double));s.n = 12;s.d[0] = 4.0;s.d[1] = 5.0;s.d[2] = 6.0;s.d[3] = 7.0;s.d[4] = 8.0; And so on - the size of the array you care about is included in the allocation, and then you can use it just like any array.  Normally such a type contains the size as part of the structure, since using the + trick to skip through an array of type s will be necessarily complicated by this situation. To your added question 'how is this construct any more or less powerful than keeping a [pointer] as the 2nd element?', it's no more powerful per se, but you don't need to keep a pointer around, so you would save at least that much space - also when you are copying the structure, you would also copy the array, rather than a pointer to an array - a subtle difference sometimes, but very important other times.  'You-can-do-it-in-multiple-ways' is probably a good explanation, but there are cases where you would specifically want one design or the other.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3047530', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/350810/']}",jdg_71034

Question:
On a scheme, being normal means that each stalk of the structure sheaf is a integrally closed domain.Being regular means that each stalk of the structure sheaf is a regular local ring. As for a local ring, being regular or being integrally closed does not imply another. What is their connection with each other and classical/usual intuition of being smooth(being regular on stalk of each closed points)? Moreover, is there a smooth/regular variety which is not normal?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Dear 7-adic, yes there is an implication between the two notions. For a local ring, regular implies normal. Actually Auslander and Buchsbaum proved in 1959 that a regular local ring is a UFD and it is an easy result that a UFD (local or not) is integrally closed. Serre then gave a completely different proof. He proved that regular is equivalent to having finite global (=homological) dimension . This finiteness means that any module over the ring has a finite projective resolution. I have heard it claimed that this was the beginning of the acknowledgment of the importance of homological algebra in commutative algebra. An example .The cone $z^2=xy$ in affine 3-space (over a field, say) is normal but not regular: its very equation suggests that we don't have the UFD property and this intuition can be converted into a rigorous proof. Normality is a weak form of regularity. The two concepts coincide in dimension one but not in higher dimensions: the quadratic cone above shows this in dimension two. Finally, smoothness is even stronger: it is a relative concept meaning regular and remaining regular after base change.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/20047', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/2666/']}",jdg_237778

","If you have an array with for example five items, the middle item is at index two: var arr = [ item, item, middle, item, item]; Dividing the length by two and using Math.round would give you index three rather than two, so you would need to subtract one from the length first: var middle = arr[Math.round((arr.length - 1) / 2)]; You say in your question that you are supposed to use Math.round , but if that is not a requirement, you can get the same result easier using Math.floor : var middle = arr[Math.floor(arr.length / 2)]; For an array with an even number of items, that will give you the second of the two items that are in the middle. If you want the first instead, use Math.floor and substract one from the length. That still gives the same result for odd number of items: var middle = arr[Math.floor((arr.length - 1) / 2)];",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/20904368', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3153403/']}",jdg_132020

Question:
In the standard models of trade, such as Ricardo or Hecksher-Ohlin, I know that openness to trade will lead to increased consumption as (roughly) the consumption possibility frontier expands beyond the PPF. However, does this mean that the countries will grow? Technically, consumption expands because the relative price of the goods in which you won't specialize will decrease. Therefore, I don't see how I could infer from this increased consumption that there has been economic growth. I am asking because I have seen many lectures jump from the classic diagrams of international trade to the idea that the baseline theory suggests that trade is benefitial to economic growth.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It depends on how you define ""growth"". Trade models have multiple goods in them, so there's no unique way to define ""growth"" - you are just moving along a fixed production possibility frontier. You can calculate nominal GDP, but then you have to come up with a measure of inflation so that you can deflate the nominal figure into something real. One of the results here is that if your economy which produces $ n $ goods has a production possibility frontier given by the zero set of a $ C^2 $ function $ Q : \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R $ (with the usual properties, i.e increasing in each coordinate and with positive definite Hessian at every point), then a simple application of the chain rule gives (here the $ dx $ notation denotes derivatives with respect to time, so we're assuming that the economy shifts continuously along the ppf instead of a unit step jump from one point to another - this assumption is important, otherwise we can't lose the higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of $ Q $...) $$ 0 = dQ = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x_k} dx_k $$ if you're moving along the ppf, so that the value of $ Q $ is conserved. However, we also know from the first order conditions of producers in a competitive market that $$ \frac{\partial Q/\partial x_i}{\partial Q / \partial x_j} = \frac{p_i}{p_j} $$ where $ p_i, p_j $ are the nominal prices of good $ i $ and good $ j $ respectively. Substituting this into the above identity gives $$ 0 = \sum_{k=1}^n p_k dx_k $$ This is an important result: it says that if you calculate growth by looking at changes in production and hold the prices fixed, then you will detect no growth if the economy moves along a fixed production possibility frontier. Furthermore, this identity combined with the identity $$ NGDP = \sum_{k=1}^{n} p_k x_k $$ gives, using the product rule, that $$ d(\log(NGDP)) = \frac{1}{NGDP} \sum_{k=1}^n x_k d p_k = \textrm{GDP deflator} $$ In other words, if we deflate GDP by using the GDP deflator which is defined as the percent change in the price of a basket of goods weighted by the share of total production they represented in a given time period, we will measure zero RGDP growth so long as the economy remains along the same production possibility frontier $ Q(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = 0 $. The results hold true in autarky as well as in an environment of free trade, so in this sense free trade does not lead to ""more growth"", at least not due to the effects present in Heckscher-Ohlin. We can get away from this result if we choose to deflate nominal GDP by an alternative measure, but I think this should be enough illustration that you should be thinking about the welfare effects of trade and not about the ""growth"" effects. If you do come up with an appropriate notion of CPI inflation in a model, it will most likely be a ""cost of living index"" of the kind you find in Dixit-Stiglitz type models, so you will still indirectly be measuring welfare. The basic proof of the first welfare theorem carries over to the case of international free trade vs autarky, so under the usual assumptions (locally nonsatiated preferences and such) free trade outcomes are Pareto optimal, whereas autarky outcomes are in general not Pareto optimal.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/20431', 'https://economics.stackexchange.com', 'https://economics.stackexchange.com/users/14708/']}",jdg_270164

I would like to prove that the two algebras $\mathfrak{su}(2)$ and $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$ are not isomorphic as Lie algebras.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Looking at a general basis will not help much, I guess, but what you have done can be completed: Note that the subspace $U = \def\<#1>{\left<#1\right>}\<A_1, A_2>$ of $\def\sl{\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbf R)}\sl$ generated by $A_1$ and $A_2$ is a subalgebra, as $[A_1, A_2] = A_2 \in U$. So $\sl$ has a two-dimensional subalgebra. We will prove that $\def\su{\mathfrak{su}(2,\mathbf C)}\su$ does not have any. Define $\phi \colon \su \to \mathbf R^3$ by $\phi(\sigma_i) = e_i$, where $e_i$ denotes the $i$-th standard unit vector. Then we have $$ \phi([\sigma_i, \sigma_j]) = \phi(\epsilon_{ijk}\sigma_k)=\epsilon_{ijk}e_k = e_i \times e_j = \phi(\sigma_i) \times \phi(\sigma_j) $$where $\epsilon_{ijk}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol and $\times$ denotes the usual cross product. Hence $$ \phi([A, B]) = \phi(A) \times \phi(B),\qquad A,B \in \su $$by linearity which implies that $\phi$ is an isomorphism of algebras of $\su$ with $(\mathbf R^3, \times)$. Now let $A, B \in \su$ be linearly independent, then $\phi(A)$ and $\phi(B)$ span a two-dimensional linear subspace $V$ of $\mathbf R^3$, hence $\phi(A) \times \phi(B)$ is a non-zero vector orthogonal to $V$; that is, $\phi([A,B]) \not\in V$, giving - as $\phi$ is invertible - $[A,B]\not\in \phi^{-1}[V] = \<A,B>$. So $A, B$ do not generate a two-dimensional subalgebra. As $A$ and $B$ were arbitrary, there isn't any. Therefore $\su$ and $\sl$ aren't isomorphic.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1466917', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/169114/']}",jdg_107305

","Ok working now, as it turns out, I had a fundamental misunderstanding of endpoints and protocols within Camel.  I should have been registering a scheme with the the https4 protocol and setting my SSLSocketFactory/SSLContext on it.  Since it Was registering a scheme with https it was never been using by the Http4 component. Here is my working solution with 2 caveats. Why can't I pass in a SchemeRegistry to the ThreadSafeClientConnManager and it is not used when constructing the HttpClient?

Question:
I need to validate my JAXB objects before marshalling to an XML file.  Prior to JAXB 2.0, one could use a javax.xml.bind.Validator.  But that has been deprecated so I'm trying to figure out the proper way of doing this.  I'm familiar with validating at marshall time but in my case I just want to know if its valid.  I suppose I could marshall to a temp file or memory and throw it away but wondering if there is a more elegant solution.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Firstly, javax.xml.bind.Validator has been deprecated in favour of javax.xml.validation.Schema ( javadoc ). The idea is that you parse your schema via a javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory ( javadoc ), and inject that into the marshaller/unmarshaller. As for your question regarding validation without marshalling, the problem here is that JAXB actually delegates the validation to Xerces (or whichever SAX processor you're using), and Xerces validates your document as a stream of SAX events. So in order to validate, you need to perform some kind of marshalling. The lowest-impact implementation of this would be to use a ""/dev/null"" implementation of a SAX processor. Marshalling to a null OutputStream would still involve XML generation, which is wasteful. So I would suggest: SchemaFactory schemaFactory = SchemaFactory.newInstance(XMLConstants.W3C_XML_SCHEMA_NS_URI);Schema schema = schemaFactory.newSchema(locationOfMySchema); Marshaller marshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller();marshaller.setSchema(schema);marshaller.marshal(objectToMarshal, new DefaultHandler()); DefaultHandler will discard all the events, and the marshal() operation will throw a JAXBException if validation against the schema fails.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/1560422', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/25501/']}",jdg_136972

Question:
I'm driving some 12v fan motors from a microcontroller using ULN2003A Darlington array. Both total wattage and per-channel wattage are way below ULN2003a limits. Still, I found that when PWM duty cycle is below 20%, ULN2003a starts to get really hot (can't touch with a finger). At higher PWM duty cycle temperature is much lower. Update: Fans draw around 0.2A each, and the PWM frequency is 32 kHz currently. The capacitors are there to reduce the audible noise (I was using lower PWM frequency initially). Am I correct in suspecting that the heat source is the flyback diodes, and not the darlingtons? I'm thinking of adding some external flyback diodes across the motor coil. Is this the corect thing to do in this situation? I have some 1N5818DICT on hand (Schottky diode 30V 1A, Recovery < 500ns). Will such diode be ok, or I I need something special?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","PWM frequency is 32 kHz so that's a period of about 32 us and half that time the transistor will be dumping energy into charging up those capacitor. It'll be doing it totally inefficiently too so maybe half that energy again is wasted in transistor heat. Capacitor acquired energy is \$\dfrac{CV^2}{2} = \dfrac{2.2 \times 10^{-6}\times 144 }{2}\$ = 0.158mJ BUT because charging the cap is done totally inefficiently, at a guess, the transistor will throw away just as much energy. It does this 32,000 times per second so that's a power of  about 5 watts per transistor. Now I may have over-egged this a bit by assuming that each 2.2uF would become totally discharged in one cycle of PWM but I'd wager that each transistor is doing over a watt just driving these capacitors back to full charge (32,000 times per second). Get rid of the caps and if you still have problems with noise then come back and tell us. The lower the duty cycle the worse this will be because there will be a longer time for these caps to discharge and hence inefficiently re-acquire more of their 0.158mJ when the transistor switches back on again.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/117109', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/4733/']}",jdg_171376

Question:
I don't have any knowledge about networks, but I noticed that my internet is rather laggy and slow. I tried performing a tracert to a particular IP which is used by my Service Provider and after 6 hops it reached the destination. Now I have an IP Address, which I wish to discover what is it (switch or something like that). Is there a command that will help me discover what it is? I know it is local 192.168.x.x but I cannot find its ""name"" Hope you can understand me, and hope it's in the right forum. Thanks in advance

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","A switch won't show up as a hop in a traceroute. I'll bet it's your home gateway/router that was supplied by your provider. Here are some very basic test steps... first, do an ipconfig and check to see if the IP address is that of your ""Default Gateway"". The default gateway is the first router you hop over, and this will be inside your home. If not, try to go to http://192.168.x.x and https://192.168.x.x . If both those fail, ping 192.168.x.x , then arp -a , find the MAC address associated with the IP, and try to find it on here: http://aruljohn.com/mac.pl . That hopefully will at least tell you the vendor of the device. If all else fails, install nmap for Windows: https://nmap.org/download.html#windows , then: nmap -P0 -O 192.168.x.x , which will possibly tell you the Operating System running on the device.

Problem: I use a trigger and a Togglebutton to perform the ""IsChecked"" to change the  background.But the background change may only happens 1 time. For example: Button Background = black --> PRESS --> Button Background = blue But when i press the button again the Button BackGround changes back to black (since its a ToggleButton). How can i make sure the background only changes 1 time? EDIT: The button must remain enabled, because a user gives in a reason when they press the button. Meaning if they pick the wrong reason they are able to change it. <Style x:Key=""ButtonStyleReg"" TargetType=""{x:Type myClasses:RegButton}""><Setter Property=""Template"">    <Setter.Value>        <ControlTemplate TargetType=""{x:Type ToggleButton}"">            <Grid x:Name=""registrationButton"">                <Rectangle Name=""rectangleBtn"" Fill=""#FF89959A"" Height=""Auto"" RadiusY=""15"" RadiusX=""15"" Stroke=""White"" Width=""Auto""/>                <TextBlock x:Name=""reason"" TextWrapping=""Wrap""                            Text=""{Binding Reason, StringFormat=\{0\}}""                           HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" Margin=""0,7.5,0,0"" Height=""Auto""                            VerticalAlignment=""Top"" FontWeight=""Bold"" >                </TextBlock>                                                                                               </Grid>            <ControlTemplate.Triggers>                <Trigger Property=""IsFocused"" Value=""True""/>                <!--<Trigger Property=""IsDefaulted"" Value=""True""/>-->                <Trigger Property=""IsChecked"" Value=""True"">                    <Setter TargetName=""rectangleBtn"" Property=""Fill"" Value=""blue"" />                </Trigger>                                                                     <Trigger Property=""IsEnabled"" Value=""False""/>            </ControlTemplate.Triggers>        </ControlTemplate>    </Setter.Value></Setter><Setter Property=""FontSize"" Value=""10.667""/> Listbox that implements the style: <ListBox x:Name=""lbRegistration"" ItemsSource=""{Binding RegBtns, ElementName=Window}"" Background=""{x:Null}""             BorderBrush=""{x:Null}"" Grid.Column=""1""             ScrollViewer.HorizontalScrollBarVisibility=""Hidden"" ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibility=""Disabled"" Height=""75"">            <ListBox.ItemsPanel>                <ItemsPanelTemplate>                    <StackPanel Orientation=""Horizontal""/>                </ItemsPanelTemplate>            </ListBox.ItemsPanel>            <ListBox.ItemTemplate>                <DataTemplate>                    <myClasses:RegistrationButton x:Name=""RegistrationButton"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" Height=""71"" Width=""148""                                                   Margin=""10,0,5,0""                                                   Style=""{DynamicResource ButtonStyleRegistration}""                                                  Click=""RegistrationButton_Click""                                                  Title=""{Binding Title}""                                                  Oorzaak=""{Binding Oorzaak}""                                                       DuurStilstand=""{Binding DuurStilstand,                                                         Converter={StaticResource  DateTimeConverter}}""                                                  BeginStilstand=""{Binding BeginStilstand}""/>                </DataTemplate>            </ListBox.ItemTemplate>        </ListBox> Best Regards, Pete

","I suppose you are mixing call and goto statements here. A label in a batch file can be used with a call or a goto , but the behaviour is different. If you call such a function it will return when the function reached the end of the file or an explicit exit /b or goto :eof (like your goto :end ). Therefore you can't cancel your batch if you use a label as a function . However, goto to a label, will not return to the caller. Using a synatx error: But there is also a way to exit the batch from a function . You can create a syntax error, this forces the batch to stop. But it has the side effect, that the local (setlocal) variables will not be removed. @echo offcall :label hellocall :label stopecho Never returnsexit /b:labelecho %1if ""%1""==""stop"" goto :haltexit /b:haltcall :haltHelper 2> nul:haltHelper() exit /b Using CTRL-C: Creating an errorcode similar to the CTRL-C errorcode stops also the batch processing. After the exit, the setlocal state is clean ! See @dbenham's answer Exit batch script from inside a function Using advanced exception handling: This is the most powerful solutions, as it's able to remove an arbitrary amount of stack levels, it can be used to exit only the current batch file and also to show the stack trace. It uses the fact, that (goto) , without arguments, removes one element from the stack.

Question:
Could somebody explain the difference between dependent types and refinement types? As I understand it, a refinement type contains all values of a type fulfilling a predicate. Is there a feature of dependent types which distinguishes them? If it helps, I came across Refined types via the Liquid Haskell project, and dependent types via Coq and Agda. That said, I'm looking for an explanation of how the theories differ.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The main differences are along two dimensions -- in the underlying theory,and in how they can be used. Lets just focus on the latter. As a user, the ""logic"" of specifications in LiquidHaskell and refinement type systems generally, is restricted to decidable fragmentsso that verification (and inference) is completely automatic, meaning one does not require ""proof terms"" of the sort needed in the full dependent setting. This leads to significant automation. For example, compare insertion sort in LH: http://ucsd-progsys.github.io/lh-workshop/04-case-study-insertsort.html#/ordered-lists vs. in Idris https://github.com/davidfstr/idris-insertion-sort/blob/master/InsertionSort.idr However, the automation comes at a price. One cannot use arbitrary functions as specifications as one can in the fully dependent world,which restricts the class of properties one can write. Thus, one goal of refinement systems is to extend the class of whatcan be specified, while that of fully dependent systems is to automate what can be proved. Perhaps there is a happy meeting ground where we can get the best of both worlds!",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/21728', 'https://cs.stackexchange.com', 'https://cs.stackexchange.com/users/2253/']}",jdg_288520

Question:
Everyone knows that two factors are better than one. My problem is that often the only second factor allowed is text messages sent to your mobile phone. This creates two concerns: I travel frequently overseas and lose access to 2FA accounts any time the associated SIM card can't touch a network. Your phone is inherently your least secured device. I install way more software and download way more files on my phone than anywhere else with much less ability to verify sources or control access. For example, nearly every app requests sweeping permissions to function correctly. Even apps that aren't granted explicit permissions have been found to backdoor those permissions through google services. I feel like linking my phone to sensitive accounts (such as banking) would actually make them more exposed to attack and more difficult to maintain legitimate access.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Is 2FA via mobile the best security there is? No. SMS 2FA is the weakest form of 2FA , however, it's still worthwhile because it does improve security and it has a relatively low barrier of entry especially for non-technical users. What can be improved? You can use TOTP token using apps like Google Authenticator. This still uses your mobile phone, but it doesn't rely on the phone number, so you can still use OTP even when your phone doesn't have connectivity. The next step after is to use dedicated hardware token that complies with either U2F or WebAuthn, like RSA token or Yubikey. Website support is fairly limited to some of the major sites, but it's a great alternative when it's available.

How can I remove reference to light.css with JS and remove all the styles that were applied and then load dark.css and apply all the styles from that? I can't simply reset all of the elements, since some of the styles are applied through different css files and some are dynamically generated by JS.

Can I give it some hints about the input? Is Mathematica lazy enough to see that I only care about the first 100 frequencies and won't calculate the others?

This is to match a paper, everybody else seems to use this form which would be more efficient because it doesn't have to thread the Fourier over all columns: CellularAutomaton[...] // Transpose // Total // Fourier // Abs

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Most of your questions can be answered experimentally. You can find out a lot about Mathematica by just interactively playing and timing results. Let's see how it works out in this case: does it automatically optimize for the type of input data (just  integers 0 and 1)? d1 = RandomReal[1, 10^7];Fourier[d1]; // AbsoluteTiming // First(*  ==> 1.0650609  *)d2 = RandomInteger[1, 10^7];Fourier[d2]; // AbsoluteTiming // First(*   ==> 1.1050632 *) So, no difference between integers and reals in this case. Note that Mathematica doesn't know no numerical Boolean values (0, 1), but only True and False and you can't perform a Fourier on that. Is Mathematica lazy enough to see that I only care about the first 100  frequencies and won't calculate the others? Mathematica has some clever optimizations going on under the hood, but this is not one of them. Compare the previous Fourier timing with this one: Fourier[d1][[1 ;; 100]]; // AbsoluteTiming // First(*  ==> 1.0740615  *) The answer,therefore, is 'no'. The reason can be discovered easily, for instance, by using TracePrint Fourier[{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}][[1 ;; 3]] // TracePrint Fourier[{1,2,3,4,5}][[1;;3]]  Part  Fourier[{1,2,3,4,5}]   Fourier   {1,2,3,4,5}  {6.708203932 +0.

Can I give it some hints about the input? Usually, no, you can't.

Question:
Hebrews 8:7 refers to something with 'fault', and the referent is almost invariably indicated to be the first 'covenant' in English translations . Some of the more literal translations miss the word out. Those that use italics to indicate the presence of an implied word, show that the word for 'covenant' is not present in the Greek of 8:7: For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second. Hebrews 8:7, NASB The preceding verse indeed mentions 'covenant', but it also mentions 'ministry'. Does Greek grammar prevent any possibility that the author intended to imply that the first 'ministry' had fault, rather than the first 'covenant'? I'm not asking whether the alternate reading makes any theological difference, only whether it is a possible understanding of the Greek: νυν[ὶ] δὲ διαφορωτέρας τέτυχεν λειτουργίας, ὅσῳ καὶ κρείττονός ἐστιν διαθήκης μεσίτης, ἥτις ἐπὶ κρείττοσιν ἐπαγγελίαις νενομοθέτηται. Εἰ γὰρ ἡ πρώτη ἐκείνη ἦν ἄμεμπτος, οὐκ ἂν δευτέρας ἐζητεῖτο τόπος. μεμφόμενος γὰρ αὐτοὺς λέγει · ἰδοὺ ἡμέραι ἔρχονται, λέγει κύριος, καὶ συντελέσω ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον Ἰούδα διαθήκην καινήν, Hebrews 8:6-8, NA27

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The Broader Context Answers ""Covenant"" Grammatically, the singular feminine ἡ πρώτη ἐκείνη (""that first"") could match to either the singular feminine λειτουργία (""ministry) or singular feminine διαθήκη (""covenant""). Proximity would argue toward the nearer referent to ""covenant,"" but proximity is not always the deciding factor as a further referent can be the antecedent. However, the broader context makes clear the first/second reference (v.7) is to covenant (v.6). This is done in three ways: There was a promise made in Jer 31:31-34 referenced in v.8-12, which was a ""new covenant"" (v.8), contrasted with a prior one (v.9), in which there is further description of that new covenant (v.10-12). Verse 13 has no ambiguity, as only the word ""new"" (καινὴν) is found there, referring back to the ""new covenant"" noted in v.8 (and ultimately back to the Jeremiah 31 reference), and again the word ""first"" is used in verse 13, unambiguously pointing back to the covenant prior to the new one. Immediately following 8:13 is 9:1 which continues with ""first"" being used as the descriptive referent back to the covenant, specifically to what contained the ""ordinances"" (δικαίωμα, v.1; so the written rules) relating to the priestly service and earthly sanctuary. So 8:6 introducing the ""better covenant"" (the second, v.7, so we are only talking about two), and v.7 begins using the word ""first"" to refer back to the prior covenant in contrast to the ""new"" one discussed in v.8-13, where ""first"" is again used in v.13 to refer to the older covenant, which first covenant was the foundational writing for the services (i.e. ministry) it contained (9:1), and which is then described in 9:2ff.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/42136', 'https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com', 'https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/users/43/']}",jdg_279872

Question:
I've been working on a problem where I ended up with a potential field expressed in terms of the following integral:$$I(u)=\int_1^u \frac{e^{-x} (2 x-1)}{\sqrt{x~(A~e^{-x}+1)-B \sqrt{x}}}dx \,,$$where $A,B\in \mathbb{R}$ are constants such that the integrand has no singularities. The integral, unfortunately, can't be solved analytically so I was hopping to show the behavior of the potential in a plot. My problem are the constants $A$ and $B$ which represent some parameters of the system that I'm studying. How can I plot the function $I$? Should I make different plots for various values of the constants? Should I present one plot for various values of $A$ and fixed $B$ and vice-versa? I would be really grateful if someone could share their experience on how to best present such information.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Because contour plots--especially 3D contour plots--are usually difficult to interpret and plots of $I$ against $u$ are familiar to physicists, consider a small multiple of such plots where $A$ and $B$ range through selected values. Experimentation is in order.  You might, for instance, overlay multiple graphs for fixed $A$: In each of these plots $B$ varies through the sequence $(-6, -1, 0, 1, 2)$ with color denoting the value of $B$; a legend would be helpful.  (The first value of $B$ is drawn in blue; the next values are drawn in red, gold, green, and so on.) You could also overlay multiple graphs for fixed $B$: In each of these plots $A$ varies through the sequence $(-2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8)$.  Again, a legend would help. Because these tableaux convey the same information in different ways, if space is available you might publish both versions. Notice how, to assist visual comparison across the cells of each tableau, identical scales and ranges on the axes were used.  Sometimes values vary so much this is not feasible, in which case you need to draw the reader's attention to the changes in the scales. Another thing worth considering is how, if at all, to standardize the plots.  It might be more meaningful physically, for instance, to scale them all so that the minimum $I(1/2)$ is equal to a constant value.  For other purposes you might standardize them to make their slopes at a distinguished value, such as $I^\prime(1) = 1/\left(\sqrt{e} \sqrt{A-e B+e}\right)$, equal to a constant.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/82115', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/37314/']}",jdg_253908

Question:
I've got a UIViewController which has three views: Category -> Sub-Category -> Detail View. The content of the Sub-Category and Detail View depends on which row is clicked in the Category view. This is done with a property called 'categoryClicked' and is declared in the sub-category.m file. It's value is given in the category.m file by the following lines of code. - (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView didSelectRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath{    Sub-category *sub = [[Sub-category alloc] initWithNibName:@""Sub-category"" bundle:nil];    sub.categoryClicked = [_categoryArray objectAtIndex:indexPath.row];    [self.navigationController pushViewController:rubrieken animated:YES];} This works perfectly fine until I want to use the value of categoryClicked in the Detail View. In both the category.m and the DetailView.m sub-category.m is imported. For testing purposes I putted a label on the Detail View and in the DetailView.m file I've got the following code: Sub-category *sub = [[Sub-category alloc] initWithNibName:@""Sub-category"" bundle:nil];label.text = sub.categoryClicked; I'm convinced this code should do the job but in fact I get an empty label.

Question:
I am reading/learning about interfaces in C# at the moment, and thus far I managed to understand how it differs from an abstract class. In the book I am reading the author explains that interfaces are the ultimate abstract class and that it simply sets the standard of certain methods the inheriting class will have, but then provides the following example. static void Main(string[] args){...Circle c = new Circle(""Lisa"");IPointy itPt = null;try{itPt = (IPointy)c;Console.WriteLine.(itPt.Points);}catch (InvalidCastException e){ Console.WriteLine(e.Message);}...} The line that absolutely throws me off is the IPointy itfPt=null; did he just declare an interface? I thought interfaces are abstract and can only be inherited? What kind of sorcery is going on here?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","That example demonstrates a try...catch more than anything. Interfaces are types too.. but they only expose their contract. So this: IPointy itPt = new IPointy(); ..won't work. Consider this: interface IPointy {    void MyMethod();}class Pencil : IPointy {    void MyMethod() {    }    void MyOtherMethod() {    }} You can declare an IPointy like this: IPointy itPt = new Pencil(); ..however, this will work: itPt.MyMethod(); ..this won't work: itPt.MyOtherMethod(); This is because MyMethod is part of the IPointy contract.. MyOtherMethod isn't.. Hopefully that helps. EDIT: Expanding this to explain my comment. Inheriting from a class represents an ""is-a"" relationship. Implementing an interface represents a ""can-do"" relationship. Consider: interface ISwitchable {    void SwitchOn();    void SwitchOff();}class Light : ISwitchable {    void SwitchOn() { }    void SwitchOff() { }}class Television : ISwitchable {    void SwitchOn() { }    void SwitchOff() { }} Both a Television and Light inherit from ISwitchable.. which is fine.

Both of the following blocks of code are valid: ISwitchable mySwitchableObject1 = new Light();ISwitchable mySwitchableObject2 = new Television();mySwitchableObject1.SwitchOn(); // calls Light's SwitchOn methodmySwitchableObject2.SwitchOn(); // calls Television's SwitchOn method",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/167808', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/65973/']}",jdg_224217

","A library is not necessarily a part of the way CodeIgniter works. It could be a homemade library, to solve a task that you want done in your CI application. This means that if you want to use any of CI's helpers, models or other libraries, you need to do this through the CI instance. This is achieved by doing this: public function __construct(){    $this->CI =& get_instance();} By assigning the instance to your librarys member named CI, all CI related helpers, models and libraries can be loaded through $this->CI . By trying to do it only with $this you are only referring to the current library - not the CI instance. To load your model correctly, in your library, $this->CI->load->model('model_name'); is enough. The second parameter allows you to access your model through a different object name. The third parameter is not necessary for loading models, but allows you to autoload the database driver. If you want to access your model through the same member: $respone = $this->CI->model_name->method();",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/14758669', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/992618/']}",jdg_229752

Question:
After having read the answers to calculating $\pi$ manually , I realised that the two fast methods (Ramanujan and Gauss–Legendre) used $\sqrt{2}$. So, I wondered how to calculate $\sqrt{2}$ manually in an accurate fashion (i.e., how to approximate its value easily).

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","One really easy way of approximating square roots surprisingly accurately was actually developed by the Babylonians. First they made a guess at the square root of a number $N$--let this guess be denoted by $r_1$. Noting that$$r_1\cdot\left(\frac{N}{r_1}\right)=N,$$they concluded that the actual square root must be somewhere between $r_1$ and $N/r_1$. Thus, their next guess for the square root, $r_2$, was the average of these two numbers:$$r_2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(r_1+\frac{N}{r_1}\right).$$Continuing in this way, in general, once we have reached the $n$th approximation to the square root of $N$, we find the $(n+1)$st using$$r_{n+1}=\frac{1}{2}\left(r_n+\frac{N}{r_n}\right).$$All that you really need to do is make a moderately decent guess of the square root of a number and then apply this method two or three times and you should have quite a good approximation. For $\sqrt{2}$, simply using a guess of $1$ and applying this method three times (the algebra involved is remarkably simple) yields an approximation of$$\frac{577}{408}\approx \color{red}{1.41421}\color{blue}{568627},$$whereas$$\sqrt{2}\approx \color{red}{1.41421}\color{green}{356237}.$$That's quite a good approximation using an easy and quick manual method.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1191473', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/60657/']}",jdg_162449

Question:
I am trying to understand how JWT authentication is stateless. In stateful authentication, there will be a session id. Here there is a JWT token which is signed. So the authentication server issues the JWT token, but can I say the validation of the JWT token in subsequent requests are done by the endpoint server (application server) rather than the authentication server. I believe this is possible as JWT is signed with expiry date (and also some other information) and the public certificate of authentication server is available to all endpoint servers. So the authentication server will be only responsible for issuing the tokens and not validation. The validation will be done by the endpoint server. Is my understanding correct? Is this how JWT is made stateless? Otherwise, I don't see how it is different from a stateful authentication as both can be implemented using tokens. In stateful authentication, the centralized server will be responsible for issuing the tokens as well as validation is each request.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are referred to as stateless because the authorizing server needs to maintain no state; the token itself is all that is needed to verify a token bearer's authorization. JWTs are signed using a digital signature algorithm (e.g. RSA) which cannot be forged.  Because of this, anyone that trusts the signer's certificate can safely trust that the JWT is authentic. There's no need for a server to consult the token-issuing server to confirm its authenticity.

Question:
Customer is the inverse side of ""keywords/customers"" relationship with Keyword : /** * @ORM\ManyToMany(targetEntity=""Keyword"", mappedBy=""customers"", *     cascade={""persist"", ""remove""} * ) */protected $keywords; When creating a new customer, one should select one or more keywords. The entity form field is: $form->add($this->factory->createNamed('entity', 'keywords', null, array(    'class'    => 'Acme\HelloBundle\Entity\Keyword',    'property' => 'select_label',    'multiple' => true,    'expanded' => true,))); In my controller code, after binding the request and check if form is valid, I need to persist both the customer and all customer/keyword(s) associations, that is the join table. However customer is the inverse side, so this is not working: if($request->isPost()) {    $form->bindRequest($request);    if(!$form->isValid()) {        return array('form' => $form->createView());    }    // Valid form here       $em = $this->getEntityManager();    $em->persist($customer);        $em->flush();} Event with ""cascade"" option, this code fails. $customer->getKeywords() will return Doctrine\ORM\PersistentCollection , which holds only selected keywords. Should I manually check which keyword was removed/added and then update from the owning side?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Ok, found the way, even if I'm not fully satisfied. The key was this example form collection field type. Basically what's happening with my previous form definition was: $customer->getKeywords() = $postData; // $postData is somewhere in form framework And that is just an assignment of a collection (of selected keywords) to customer keywords. No method were invoked on Keyword instances (owning side). The key option is by_reference (for me it's just a bad name, but anyways...): $form    ->add($this->factory->createNamed('entity', 'keywords', null, array(        // ...        'by_reference' => false    ))); This way the form framework is going to call the setter, that is $customer->setKeywords(Collection $keywords) . In that method, you can ""tell"" the owning side to store your association: public function setKeywords(Collection $keywords){    foreach($keywords as $keyword) {        $keyword->addCustomer($this); // Owning side call!    }    $this->keywords = $keywords;    return $this;} (Always check for duplicate instances on the owning side, using contains method). At this point, only checked keywords will be added ( $keyword argument). There is the need to manage removal of unchecked keywords (controller side): $originalKeywords = $customer->getKeywords()->toArray(); // When GET or POST// When POST and form valid$checkedKeywords = $customer->getKeywords()->toArray(); // Thanks to setKeywords// Loop over all keywordsforeach($originalKeywords as $keyword) {    if(!in_array($keyword, $checkedKeywords)) { // Keyword has been unchecked        $keyword->removeCustomer($customer);        $manager->persist($keyword);    }} Ugly, but works.

Question:
I'm kind of curious about what the best practice is when referencing the 'global' namespace in javascript, which is merely a shortcut to the window object (or vice versia depending on how you look at it). I want to know if: var answer = Math.floor(value); is better or worse than: var answer = window.Math.floor(value); Is one better or worse, even slightly, for performance, resource usage, or compatibility? Does one have a slighter higher cost? (Something like an extra pointer or something) Edit note :  While I am a readability over performance nazi in most situations, in this case I am ignoring the differences in readability to focus solely on performance.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","First of all, never compare things like these for performance reasons. Math.round is obviously easier on the eyes than window.Math.round , and you wouldn't see a noticeable performance increase by using one or the other. So don't obfuscate your code for very slight performance increases. However, if you're just curious about which one is faster... I'm not sure how the global scope is looked up ""under the hood"", but I would guess that accessing window is just the same as accessing Math ( window and Math live on the same level, as evidenced by window.window.window.Math.round working). Thus, accessing window.Math would be slower. Also, the way variables are looked up, you would see a performance increase by doing var round = Math.round; and calling round(1.23) , since all names are first looked up in the current local scope, then the scope above the current one, and so on, all the way up to the global scope. Every scope level adds a very slight overhead. But again, don't do these optimizations unless you're sure they will make a noticeable difference. Readable, understandable code is important for it to work the way it should, now and in the future.

I guess accessing the global window object adds additional overhead. However, the difference between accessing the Math object from the global scope, and just accessing a local variable with a reference to the Math.round function isn't very great... Keep in mind that this is 100,000 calls, and the difference is only 3.6ms. Even with one million calls you'd only see a 36ms difference. Things to think about with the above profiling code: The functions are actually looked up from another scope, which adds overhead (barely noticable though, I tried importing the functions into the anonymous function). The actual Math.round function adds overhead (I'm guessing about 6ms in 100,000 calls).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2125113', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/25847/']}",jdg_198908

Question:
We recently reinstalled our server due to a disk failure, and now we're having an issue with resizing terminals. We installed Debian 6.0.6. Symptoms When you resize a terminal, no ncurses-based apps (tested: ytalk, irssi, screen, tmux, some of the ncurses example applications) seem to resize correctly. The screen typically ends up blank. Forcing a redraw in the application will redraw using the old terminal size. When resizing a window at a bash (4.1.5(1)) prompt, the COLUMNS and LINES variables are never updated. Diagnostics Attempting to trap the SIGWINCH in bash, it seems it is never being received. This was tested with: trap 'touch /home/user/sigwinch' SIGWINCHtrap 'touch /home/user/sigusr1' SIGUSR1kill -s SIGWINCH $$kill -s SIGUSR1 $$ Which should have created both files in my home directory. It only created /home/user/sigusr1 . Trying to kill -s SIGWINCH $$ does not cause an update of the $COLUMNS/$LINES variables. Enabling checkwinsize ( shopt -s checkwinsize ) will cause bash to update $COLUMNS/$LINES upon return from any application (as expected). This leads to the following after resizing a terminal with checkwinsize enabled: $ echo $COLUMNS ; ls > /dev/null ; echo $COLUMNS72107 Changing my login shell to something like tcsh and attempting to resize the terminal works as expected, as does bash on other boxes I tested. I tried removing my .bashrc and it did nothing. This problem is occurring for several other users with varying bash configurations in both PuTTY and some sort of rxvt-type terminal from a Linux box. strace I ran strace on bash and tried resizing the terminal, nothing came through (it remained blocked on a read call immediately after printing the prompt). I hit return on an empty line, and bash did a whole bunch of stuff. The output I believe to be relevant is: ( full strace ) 1: rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [WINCH], NULL, 8) = 02: rt_sigaction(SIGWINCH, {0x80e2c20, [], SA_RESTART}, {0x809c310, [], 0}, 8) = 03: rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [INT], [WINCH], 8) = 04: write(2, ""aa:~$ "", 6)                   = 65: rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [WINCH], NULL, 8) = 06: rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, NULL, [WINCH], 8) = 07: read(0, Which shows bash, to my understanding: (I could be horribly misunderstanding this. I'm way out of my element here.) 1: Disabling delivery of the SIGWINCH signal, when previously it was allowed.2: Registering a handler for the SIGWINCH signal.3: Masking some other combination of signals. As evidenced by line 5, this does not include SIGWINCH.4: Printing the prompt.5: Masking SIGWINCH, where previously nothing was blocked.6: Masking the ""union of null and SIGWINCH"" which, to my understanding, would result in SIGWINCH being masked.7: Waiting on input. This same strace performed on a box without these issues (Ubuntu, bash 4.2.24(1)) resulted in: 1: rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 02: rt_sigaction(SIGWINCH, {0x49e320, [], SA_RESTORER|SA_RESTART, 0x7f7ef49f64c0}, {0x457880, [], SA_RESTORER, 0x7f7ef49f64c0}, 8) = 03: rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, [INT], [], 8) = 04: write(2, ""aaaaaaa:~$ "", 11)             = 115: rt_sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, [], NULL, 8) = 06: rt_sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, NULL, [], 8)  = 07: read(0, Question What in the hell is going on and why is my bash broken? :( I'm guessing there's probably just an option somewhere that defaulted to something unexpected, but hours on Google have turned up nothing. Any help and/or pointers are greatly appreciated. This is really frustrating. Thank you.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Something had been bugging me about the strace output. Namely that it seemed that when bash started, it seemed it already had SIGWINCH masked. Couldn't be sure, didn't understand half of what it was spitting out, but it was certainly worth some exploration at this point. I ran strace -o strace_file bash -l from a tcsh shell, where the issue was not present. bash never masked SIGWINCH. When it was masking it, it was only because it was attempting to restore the previous mask. So where was the initial mask coming from? Some more time on Google and a fresh mind and I found this post which mentioned that aptitude can sometimes cause sshd to be started with SIGWINCH masked, and that it will then be inherited by all the spawned processes straight down to the shell. I tried ps axwwws (all, detached, wide output, signals). It showed several of the spawned sshd processes had SIGWINCH masked. The server/listening process (sshd itself) did not. Nor did the processes which were hosting connections which used tcsh. That part is confusing to me. I'm guessing (again, knowing very little about any of this) that the signal mask is process-group wide or something, tcsh was resetting it on start, and that was affecting ssh as well. So, on a whim, I connected in with tcsh (to get a clean term with no SIGWINCH mask), restarted ssh, changed my shell back to bash... And it worked! Everything's back to normal! As far as I know aptitude has not been run on this box, and ssh has been restarted a few times for configuration changes. Somewhere along the line the mask made its way in, though, and infected everything like a bad disease. To recognize the same issue, run ps axwwws | grep sshd and look for sshd processes with the second long column ( BLOCKED ) has 0x8000000 set. That's SIGWINCH. Something like: 0 26425 0000000000000000 0000000008000000 0000000000001000 0000000180004003 Ss   ?          0:00 sshd: aa [priv]1000 26430 0000000000000000 0000000008000000 0000000000001000 0000000180010000 S    ?          0:02 sshd: aa@pts/24 To fix it (possibly not the best solution, worked for me): $ sudo apt-get install tcsh[snip]$ chsh -s /bin/tcsh[connect in with a new connection, leave the old one open in case of any issues with tcsh]$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart And it's fixed.

","I have found a solution to the problem and have modified your classes so that this error no longer occurs. The only major difference was that you should use a DialogFragment instead of a Dialog , that way you have access to call getChildFragmentManager() and receive the correct FragmentManager from the DialogFragment . Even though you were using getChildFragmentManager() before, it was coming from MyFragment and the PagerDialog class was not a child fragment in MyFragment . I have tested the code below, and it should be working fine now.

Question:
The other day I was reading a little about Unit Testing and I saw some examples where people create a repository interface (i.e. IExampleRepository ) and then create the real repository ( public class ExampleRepository : IExampleRepository ) and a repository to be used for unit testing ( FakeExampleRepository : IExampleRepository ). In the IExampleRepository they were implementing the same methods as in the ExampleRepository , however with different Linq queries. What is exactly the objective here? I thought one part of unit testing your code is make sure that a method works correctly? But when I use two totally different queries, one for 'real' and one in the test, how much sense does the test make?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","One of the aims of unit testing is to test just one thing at a time i.e. a single class and method. If the repository itself is not under test then you would normally mock this out in some way so as just to test the logic in your method/class. That said you do also need to test with a 'real' repository*, but this would normally be done in an integration/system test * obviously real as in repo set up for test, hopefully not e.g. the production DB.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/194249', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/11072/']}",jdg_301313

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Being systematic a $2$-special group is specified completely by two $\mathbb Z/2$-vectorspaces $U=G/Z(G)$ and $V=Z(G)$ together with the induced square map $\Gamma^2U\to V$which is non-degenerate in the following sense: We have an injective map $\Lambda^2U\to\Gamma^2U$mapping $u\land v\mapsto\gamma_1(u)\gamma_1(v)$ so that the composite $\Lambda^2U\to\Gamma^2U\to V$ is non-degenerate.Every map $\Gamma^2U\to V$ occurs for some central extension of $V$ by $U$ and theextension gives a $2$-special group precisely when $\Lambda^2U\to\Gamma^2U\to V$ isnon-degenerate. For $V=(\mathbb Z/2)^2$ a map $\Lambda^2U\to V$ corresponds to a pair of alternatingforms on $U$ and the non-degeneracy says exactly that the radicals of the twoforms intersect in zero. Now, if $V$ is even-dimensional there is a singlenon-degenerate alternating form and if $V$ is odd-dimensional, then any$1$-dimensional subspace is the radical of some alternating form so that if$\dim V>1$ there are always two forms whose radicals intersecttrivially. Picking such a map $\Lambda^2U\to V$ we simply may take any linear extensionto a map $\Gamma^2U\to V$ to get a $2$-special group.

","A struct cannot have multiple conflicting definitions.  As such, you can't create a struct that hides some of the fields.

How does Perl read in files, how does it tell it to advance to the next line in the text file, and how does it make it read all lines in the .txt file until, for example, it reaches item ""banana""?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Basically, there are two ways of reading files: Slurping a file means reading the file all at once. This uses a lot of memory and takes a while, but afterwards the whole file contents are in memory and you can do what you want with it. Reading a file line-per-line (in a while loop) is better if you don't want to read the entire file (for example, stop when you reach ""banana""). For both ways you need to create a FILEHANDLE using the ""open"" command, like so: open(my $yourhandle, '<', 'path/to/file.txt') # always use a variable here containing filename    or die ""Unable to open file, $!""; Then you can either slurp the file by putting it into an array: my @entire_file=<$yourhandle>; # Slurp! or read the file one by one using a while loop while (<$yourhandle>) { # Read the file line per line (or otherwise, it's configurable).   print ""The line is now in the $_ variable"";   last if $_ eq 'banana'; # Leave the while-loop.} Afterwards, don't forget to close the file. close($yourhandle)    or warn ""Unable to close the file handle: $!""; That's just the basics.. there's a lot to do with files, especially in Exception handling (what to do when the file does not exist, is not readable, is being written to), so you'll have to read up or ask away :)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2810145', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1488774/']}",jdg_108742

Question:
I've been learning about networks recently at a new job, and I did a presentation on what I've learnt so far. When I was describing the relationship between the datalink and network layer, I mentioned that datalink handles the hops while network is end to end. After I was done they grilled me with some questions, and one of them asked me if the datalink layer handles packets traveling across the internet, to which I replied yes. They told me I was wrong, but I didn't ask them for the right answer because I was nervous and it really didn't cross my mind to ask. But now that I've gone back to researching this topic I'm starting to get confused and I was hoping I could have someone clear this up for me. Was I wrong? Or perhaps I explained it poorly? Here's my knowledge so far: The packet comes with headers that contain information concerning packet delivery and whatnot. The IP header has the source and destination IP address for the packet, which is used to get the packet across the internet. On the other hand the layer 2 frame header (ethernet or whatever) has the MAC address of the source (which would be the original host at this point) and the MAC address of the next router the packet is to be sent to (using ARP). The IP packet is left alone but with each hop the frame header is rewritten with a new source (the router's) MAC address and a new destination (the next hop). This is repeated within the network until a gateway within that network is reached, where the packet is then forwarded onto the ISP/provider's network. The same thing happens within the ISP/provider's network, with the packet (frame) being sent over the datalink layer while using the IP header for ARP. EGPs like BGP are used across networks, and IGPs are used within networks. And while IP addresses indicate the final destination, even over the internet MAC addresses are used to transport the data from router to router. This makes sense to me because the internet is physically connected and MAC addresses are king when it comes to physical connections. But after being told I was wrong I've kinda lost confidence and now I'm just confusing myself. Is a different protocol or method used when data is sent from within the local network into the internet? Are MAC addresses only relevant within a network? Any help clearing this up for me is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You need to look at the layers as each having its own mission. The network layer is - as you wrote - end-to-end. Its addresses have global meaning (within the scope of the entire network). Accordingly, a network layer packet has a source and a destination address that don't change. NAT messes this up, but that can be seen as a translation layer or context change. However, the network layer's mission is to make the packet routable along the hops across the network. It doesn't actually move the data. Instead, it uses the data link layer to get the data from one node to another within the current segment . The data link layer's task is to move data (frames) across the local segment - or from the global perspective, hop-to-hop. The segment can hold a fairly large number of nodes, so you need a way to distinguish or address them - that's where MAC addresses come into play (for Ethernet and other MAC-based segments). The network layer packet is encapsulated in a data link layer frame, addressed to the next hop's ""hardware"" address (local to the segment) and sent over. Note that the hardware/MAC address is only meaningful within the scope of its segment. For completeness, the data link layer doesn't actually move data either. Instead, it uses the physical layer to move the bits of the frame from one place to another, one link at a time (so you might say the physical layer is link-to-link). Which one of the potentially many physical layer links is used (on a switch) is controlled by the data link layer (switching) - on a switch, the destination MAC address is used to select the port forwarding from. For this, the switch queries its MAC table (also source address table SAT, or content-addressable memory CAM). (In original Ethernet with multi-point connects or repeaters, the frame was forwarded to all nodes and simply ignored by all of them but the one addressed.) At the end of the segment, the packet is extracted from the frame and forwarded across the next segment to the next hop. Which segment is used beyond that hop is controlled by the network layer's routing, ie. the current hop's/router's/gateway's routing table. At the end, across all hops, the network packet is delivered to its destination address - voilà.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/54065', 'https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com', 'https://networkengineering.stackexchange.com/users/51115/']}",jdg_334089

Question:
For C++ STL containers such as vector and list , the complexity of finding elements and inserting or removing them is self-explanatory. However, for the map container, even though I know from my reading that the access and insertion complexity/performance is O(log(n)), I can't work out why . I clearly don't understand maps as much as I need to, so some enlightenment on this topic would be very much appreciated.

","The elements of a map or set are contained in a tree structure; every time you examine a node of the tree, you determine if the element you're trying to find/insert is less than or greater than the node. The number of times you need to do this (for a properly balanced tree) is log2(N) because each comparison throws out half of the possibilities.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/11234921', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1472459/']}",jdg_81042

Question:
I recently came across the identity $$\sum_{k=0}^m\dbinom{m}{k}\cdot \frac{(-1)^k}{n+k+1}=\dfrac{n!\cdot m!}{(n+m+1)!},$$ while working on evaluating $$\int_0^1 x^n(1-x)^m\, dx.$$ I ended up showing that both sides of the identity were equal to this integral, but I was wondering if there was a way to show directly (either by manipulation or some combinatorial argument) that one was equal to the other.

","One possible combinatorial explanation results from multiplying everything by $n+1$:$$\sum_{k=0}^m \binom{m}{k} (-1)^k \frac{n+1}{n+1+k} = \frac{1}{\binom{n+m+1}{m}}.$$On the left-hand side we have an inclusion-exclusion formula, which counts the probability that none of the bad events $B_1,\ldots,B_m$ happen; the probability that $k$ specific bad events happen is $(n+1)/(n+1+k)$. One possible experiment which can underlie this identity is the one in which you sample $m$ balls with replacement out of $n+2$ ""colors"", with uniform distribution over the $\binom{n+m+1}{m}$ different choices. The bad event $B_i$ is that ball $i$ doesn't get color $1$, say. The probability that none of the bad events happen is exactly $1/\binom{n+m+1}{m}$. Each single balls is chosen uniformly, so the probability of $B_i$ is indeed $(n+1)/(n+2)$. I conjecture that the probability of the conjunction of any $k$ bad events is $(n+1)/(n+1+k)$, which implies your identity.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1330699', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/183661/']}",jdg_232787

Question:
I've inherited C# code that has an awful lot of DateTimes where the Kind property is DateTimeKind.Unspecified.  These are fed into Datetime.ToUniversalTime() which gives back a UTC datetime (it adds 7 hours in my case). This is how ToUniversalTime() works; see MSDN. The problem is that these DateTimes are in fact already in UTC time.  They are pulled out of a SQL Server Compact 4.0 database.  They were stored there in UTC.  My main question is: How do I modify the Kind property of a DateTime so that it's UTC and not Unspecified?  I don't want to change the time or date.  So for example, a date of April 1st 2013, 9:05 am with its Kind property of ""Unspecified"" should become a datetime of April 1st 2013, 9:05 UTC. If I could be indulged with a follow up question(s), it would be: Are values necessarily returned from Sql Server Compact as ""Unspecified""?  Inside Sql Server Compact, they are being stored as type (datetime, not null).   Looking at the code, it appears they are just put in the database, but there are no provisions to mark them as UTC or anything.  Is there a better way to handle things?  Is there a slick way to ensure the DateTimes come out of SQL Compact as UTC? Please let me know if I can provide more details.  I'm new to this code base and still getting my brain around it, so I'm having trouble describing the problem perfectly. Dave

","You need to do something in order to let PHP see your base class definition before it can process the child class, otherwise a fatal error will occur. This something can be either a manual require_once of the base class file, or autoloading (there are other options for autoloading, but spl_autoload_register is the one you should use). Which approach to use depends on the scope: when coding a small test project setting up autoloading is probably overkill. But as the code base gets larger and larger, autoloading becomes more attractive because: it can hide complex source file resolution logic (e.g. if you have a configurable directory for the base classes; there are more advanced scenarios as well) it can be configured incrementally: you can use multiple autoloaders that run as a chain, and each independent module of the application can register its independent autoloader that coexists peacefully with all the others",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/11222809', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/962206/']}",jdg_93751

If I type sudo at the beginning of a one liner in bash, does it apply to the rest of the commands? In other words, is this: sudo foo | foo2 | foo3 equivalent to this: sudo foo | sudo foo2 | sudo foo3

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As a way to convince yourself that sudo only runs using the first command provided it, and everything else after the first pipe is run as your original user ID you can use this useless chain of commands to see it. Example #1 $ sudo whoami > file1 | whoami > file2 | whoami > file3 Then when you cat those files you'll see the following usernames: $ cat file{1..3}rootsamlsaml Example #2 However if you run a subshell: $ sudo sh -c 'whoami > file4 | whoami > file5 | whoami > file6' Then when you cat these files you'll see the following usernames: $ cat file{4..6}rootrootroot Example #3 Your comment about sudo foo1 | sudo foo2 ... would never work, since the output from sudo foo1 would be fed to sudo foo2 . Using my whoami examples this shows that that chain of commands does nothing. $ sudo whoami | sudo whoami | sudo whoamiroot The 1st one ran, but the 2nd and 3rd don't do anything since they aren't equipped to take input. Rather I think you meant to write something like this: $ sudo whoami;sudo whoami;sudo whoamirootrootroot Which is equivalent to running it 3 times on 3 different command prompts. Or this: $ sudo whoami && sudo whoami && sudo whoamirootrootroot But don't ever do this last one. It belongs in the next section. Obscure ways to call sudo These are not my best work but are other ways you might have seen me executing multiple commands using sudo . I show them here only to teach not so that others will necessarily do them! Way #1 $ echo ""echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"" | sudo sh How it works? The echo program inside the double quotes is running as root, because of sudo, but the shell that's redirecting echo's output to the root-only file is still running as you. Your current shell does the redirection before sudo starts. Way #2 $ sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches <<<1 How it works? This method runs the tee program as root AND takes input from a here string which runs prior to sudo invoking the tee command. Way #3 # this way$ sudo -s -- 'whoami'# or this waysudo -s -- sh -c 'whoami;whoami' How it works? These might look different but they're really doing the same thing. When using the -s switch, sudo will run a single command. I could never figure out if there was a way to escape it. Nothing like these would work. # this$ sudo -s -- 'whoami;whoami'# or this$ sudo -s -- 'whoami\;whoami' But in looking at the man page, the -s switch says that it will pass a single command to the shell defined in the user's entry of the /etc/passwd file. So we use a trick in the second form, mainly passing the shell, another shell ( sh -c ) in which we ""backdoor"" our string of commands to run. There are more but I will stop here. These are only to show you what you can do if you understand things, but should not necessarily just chain junk together because you can, you should try and keep your code pragmas to as logical level that makes sense so that others can both understand and support them in the future.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/90148', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/1822/']}",jdg_239596

Question:
Hy there I would like to have three apps depending, which are based on the same code: MyAppDevelopment (Builds from Xcode that are deployed to the device) MyAppPreview (Beta testing) MyApp (Release) It should be possible to have all of the three Apps installed on a device and they'd have their own icon to nicely distinguish them visually. Now I know that I could have three different targets with their respective Info.plist file, but I would rather use Xcode's configurations so that I don't have to maintain three different targets. Is this possible using configurations, the problem is that the App identifier is stored in the Info.plist file, which can be defined per-target...

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Using different targets for different editions of Apps provides more flexibility and lets you easily change the bundle identifier and the icon etc once you specify a different plist file per target. However, the configurations are more deeply integrated with Xcode and you can adjust any build setting per configuration. After some more research I figured out how to get the best of both worlds with just one target: Create the desired configurations in Xcode: ProjectName > ProjectName > Info . For example: Debug Preview Release Now these three configurations are available for all the build settings. The three Apps should co-exist on a device.I want to be able to have all three versions of the App on one device, for this all three types need a different bundle identifier. The original Identifier could be com.company.${PRODUCT_NAME:rfc1034identifier} . To achieve this go to MyProject > MyApp (Target) > Build settings and click on the button (+) Add Build Setting Add the new key ${APP_ID} and set the values like this and note that the release configuration should not have a suffix: APP_ID > 'com.company.MyApp-debug'       > 'com.company.MyApp-preview'       > 'com.company.MyApp' Now in your Info.plist change the Bundle Identifier value to ${APP_ID} You can do the same with the Bundle Display Name or the Icon attribute so that you can easily distinguish the app at one glance. You can set Preprocessor macros for your configurations in order to be able to detect the current configuration in your code. This is done by default for the debug configuration: DEBUG=1 . Advantages Since the three Apps have their own identifier, you won't override the latest preview build when testing the current App in Xcode. Nicely integrated into Xcode and offers a high flexibility All build settings can now individually be changed per configuration New configurations can easily be added by cloning existing configurations within Xcode No need for additional targets Targets are IMHO better for completely different artifacts like libraries or testing targets that have a different code base. The configurations can be used in code if required. Different Service URLS etc. can be used for different environments. See this great post (Thanks to Jonah!) that shows how to do this using a special plist file. No use of any hacky scripts which are hard to maintain Disadvantages With using targets it would be possible to exclude some frameworks from a type of App. So for example you could exclude some analytics library from the debug edition of your App. Update : You can't use substitutions like com.company.${PRODUCT_NAME:rfc1034identifier} for User defined Build Settings. So you'll have to write out the bundle whole bundle identifier in this case. Update : Some settings which should be made ""configuration aware"" move to the User-Defined section of the Build Settings, which might feel unusual for some developers.

I'm using drag & drop with this as tutorial http://isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/ my code looks like this: $(window).load(function(){   if(temp == 0)    {         DP(""eerste keer"")        load_table();         temp = 1;    }} );function load_table(){        DP('load_table');    $.ajax({            //async: false,            type: ""POST"",            url: ""/diagnose_hoofdpagina/table_diagnose/"" + DosierID, // <== loads requested page            success: function (data) {                    $(""#diagnoses_zelf"").html(''); //<== clears current content of div                    $(""#diagnoses_zelf"").append(data).trigger('create'); // <== appends requested page                },            error: function(){                alert('error');              }         }).done(function() {        update_table();         initialize_table();    // <== calls jquery plug in        });    return false;   }function initialize_table() {    var tableid = $('#diagnoses_zelf table').attr('id'); //< this finds the correct table thanks to Fábio Batista => this option worked, rest didn't    alert(tableid);    $(tableid).tableDnD({            onDrop: function(table, row) {        alert(table + ""     ""  +  row);        },        onDragStart: function(table,row){        var tette = $(row).index;        alert(tette);        },        dragHandle: "".dragHandle""    });     } How is this possible and what can I do about it?Can anyone help me with this please. Very short:I want access to the ID of the table I load into my container page with ajax and use the jquery drag and drop plug in on it. EDIT Findings: Somehow my table in the container page got renamed to pSqlaTable instead of the id I gave to it in the controller page which is. <table id=""tableDiagnose"" class=""table table-hover""> Thats why the code couldn't find the table annymore Got fixed by this code thanks to Fábio Batista: $('#diagnoses_zelf table').tableDnD( ... ); , but how can I use the dnd plugin now ? It finds the table now, but I'm still not able to bind the dnd plugin to it, Am I able to bind a jquery plug in to ajax loaded tables ? EDIT //drag & drop http://isocra.com/2008/02/table-drag-and-drop-jquery-plugin/function initialize_table() {    var tableid = $('#diagnoses_zelf table').attr('id');    alert(tableid);    $('#' + tableid).tableDnD({            onDrop: function(table, row) {        alert(table + ""     ""  +  row);        },        onDragStart: function(table,row){        alert('issemer?');        },        dragHandle: "".dragHandle""    });    } This is the code i'm still stuck with. tableid is correct but the initialisation of the jquery isn't. I can't drag the drows in the table. Is my syntax wrong ? EDIT Could it be that I can't bind the jquery to the table because I dynamicaly generate the table on the other page with ZPT (or javascript) ?

","The issue with plugins. You're mixing lots of external libraries and code. This results in possible mis-matches between versions, and a lot of black boxes in your code. As a developer, this should make you feel very uneasy. Having code you do not fully understand in your code base can get really frustrating really fast. The alternative. Often, these sort of plugins provide functionality we, as JavaScript developers can accomplish just as easily without them. This development process, in simple enough scenarios, lets us create code we understand and have an easier time maintaining. Not only do we learn from this process, but we also create smaller bits of specific code. Community driven solutions are very good in general, but it's important to remember they're not a silver bullet. Often you're stuck using a not-so-active project which has a bug for your specific case and you have to dig through a large, unfamiliar code base. Your code So what does this drag and drop plugin do? Well, I'd break it down as the following: Listens to the mousedown event on table rows When such an event fires, start moving the table row to match the mouse position When mouseup occurs, detect that, and finalize the position. Let us see how we can do something similar. Let's assume the table's HTML is something like: <table>    <tbody>    <tr>        <td> Hello 1</td>    </tr><tr>        <td> Hello 2</td>    </tr>    </tbody></table> Here is a fiddle with the table with some basic styling applied Next, we'll listen to the selection events. We'll add an event to the table rows for selection and to the document to when the mouse is up. jQuery has event listeners for such events. Since we want these events to stick even after AJAX, we'll use .on which lets us use delegated events. .on means that even if we add content to the table later, it won't matter. var selected; // currently selected row$(document).on(""mousedown"",""#MySpecialTable tr"",function(){   $(""#textDiv"").text(this.textContent);     selected = this;});$(document).on(""mouseup"",function(){    $(""#textDiv"").text(""Left ""+selected.textContent);     selected = null;}); Here is a working fiddle of such code. Now, we'll want to actually change the drag&drop to work when, that is, update the current position to the one reflecting the mouse position. We can listen to mousemove events, and detect the element we're currently on. Something like $(document).on(""mousemove"",function(e){    $(""#textDiv"").text($(e.target).html());}); You can see a working fiddle here That's nice, but we want to actually change the element position. So we'll need to change the table structure to allow that. We can remove the element, and append it at the correct position. We'll check if we have a selected element, and if we do, we can track it compared to the current element in the mousemove event. We can for starters detect if we should drag with something like: $(document).on(""mousemove"",function(e){    if(selected !=null){// got an element selected        if($(""#MySpecialTable"").has(e.target).length > 0){ //in the table            $(""#mousePos"").text(""DRAGGING"");            }    }else{        $(""#mousePos"").text(""NOT SELECTED"");    }}); (Fiddle) Now, we'll add actual selection, we'll replace the elements when the target is not our element and we're in the table. Our full code should be something like: var selected;$(document).on(""mousedown"",""#MySpecialTable tr"",function(e){    e.preventDefault();//stop the text selection;   $(""#textDiv"").text(this.textContent);     selected = $(this);    selected.find(""td"").css(""background-color"",""#999"");});$(document).on(""mouseup"",function(){    $(""#textDiv"").text(""Left ""+selected.text());     selected.find(""td"").css(""background-color"","""");    selected = null;});$(document).on(""mousemove"",function(e){    if(selected !=null){// got an element selected        if($(""#MySpecialTable"").has(e.target).length > 0){ //in the table            var el = $(e.target).closest(""tr"");//the tr element we're on            el.before(selected);// replace the elements        }    }else{        $(""#mousePos"").text(""NOT SELECTED"");    }});$(""#MySpecialTable"").on('selectstart', false);//Don't let the user select the table ( Fiddle ) Now, so far we only have a few lines of code, which is nice since we know exactly what's going on and didn't need to use lots of lines of external code we don't fully understand. But will it AJAX? Let's load the data into the table with AJAX and see! We'll simulate an AJAX response using a setTimeout which would allow us to simulate an asynchronous request. We'll use setTimeout(function(){    $(""#MySpecialTable"").html(""<tr><td> Hello 1</td></tr><tr><td> Hello 2</td></tr><tr><td> Hello 3</td></tr><tr><td> Hello 4</td></tr><tr><td> Hello 5</td></tr><tr><td> Hello 6</td></tr>"");},1000); This means, update the HTML of #MySpecialTable after one second. Let's see if it works shall we? So why does it work? well, we used delegated events which means we don't care if the elements we're loading are in the screen right now or not. We had the insight to do this since we built our code ourselves and knew what our final goal was. The only thing left to do is clean the code a little. We'll wrap our code in the following, to prevent $ from being an issue in non-conflict mode (that is, $ is already taken in the page: (function($){})(jQuery); Next we'll add a binding for our table event: $.GertVDragTable = function(elementSelector){ // rest of code. Eventually, our code might look something like this. Using it, would be a simple $.GertVDragTable(""#MySpecialTable""); alternatively, we can put it on $.fn and allow every function to call it. Which is a matter of taste. No copy-pasta please :) I'd appreciate it if you stop on every stage and think why the next step was taken.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/16761175', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1348231/']}",jdg_324217

Question:
I installed ExtReact, with examples.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Why? Programs that sync files such as dropbox, git etc use inotify to notice changes to the file system. The limit can be see by - cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches For me, it shows 100000 . When this limit is not enough to monitor all files inside a directory it throws this error. Increasing the amount of inotify watchers(Short version): If you are running Debian, RedHat, or another similar Linux distribution , run the following in a terminal: echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p If you are running ArchLinux , run the following command instead (see here for why): echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/40-max-user-watches.conf && sudo sysctl --system Then paste it in your terminal and press on enter to run it. Technical details: Listen uses inotify by default on Linux to monitor directories for changes. It's not uncommon to encounter a system limit on the number of files you can monitor. For example, Ubuntu Lucid's (64bit) inotify limit is set to 8192. You can get your current inotify file watch limit by executing: $ cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches When this limit is not enough to monitor all files inside a directory, the limit must be increased for Listen to work properly. You can set a new limit temporary with: $ sudo sysctl fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288$ sudo sysctl -p If you like to make your limit permanent, use: $ echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf$ sudo sysctl -p You may also need to pay attention to the values of max_queued_events and max_user_instances if Listen keeps on complaining.

","EDIT: An update for .NET 6 is below ↓ Not much has changed with .NET 7. I'd start off with the default worker template. It comes with necessary packages pre-installed. If you already have a project, install Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting package. dotnet new worker -n MyCli Then open up the Program.cs and build the host. Remove the Worker hosted service if you don't want to go with the hosted service route. public class Program{    public static void Main(string[] args)    {        var host = CreateHostBuilder(args).Build();    }    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)            .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>            {                // remove the hosted service                // services.AddHostedService<Worker>();                // register your services here.            });} Build your logic: internal class MyService{    // you can also inject other services    private ILogger<MyService> _logger;    public MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger)    {        _logger = logger;    }    public void DoSomething()    {        _logger.LogInformation(""Doing something"");    }} Then register the class inside .ConfigureServices method Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>    {        services.AddTransient<MyService>();    }); Now you can resolve and call it inside the Main method: public static void Main(string[] args){    var host = CreateHostBuilder(args).Build();    var myService = host.Services.GetRequiredService<MyService>();    myService.DoSomething();} .NET 6 update With .NET 6, boilerplate is reduced significantly.

Question:
I am working on a metabolomics data set of 81 samples x 407 variables with ~17% missing data. I would like to compare a number of imputation methods to see which is best for my data. Is there a general rule for the order of pre-treating a data set? Should I impute first and normalize after or normalize first? I have tried both ways with k-nearest-neighbor imputation and normalization to the median and compared the results using PCA and there are very few differences in the factor maps. However when using Random Forest imputation the imputation error is much higher if I normalize the data first (normalized data NRMSE = 0.708, raw data NRMSE = 0.122). My two main questions are: Should imputation or normalization of data come first? and Does the order depend on the imputation function used?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","In my opinion, since you are using kNN imputation, and kNN is based on distances you should normalize your data prior to imputation kNN.

That means you are settled, you can do whatever you want. What you need is a QWidgetAction object. It allows you to insert a custom widget as an action. Your titles will be custom widgets.

I'm preparing myself for discrete math exam, and I have no problem when dealing with simple sum, but when I see a monstrous one I totally don't know what to do. Here's an example: $$\sum_{1\leq i < j \leq m}\sum_{1\leq k,l \leq n}[k+l\leq n]\binom{n}{k}\binom{n-k}{l}(j-i-1)^{n-k-l}$$ for $m,n > 0$. I need to simplify this sum.

Question:
I've used lme4 to fit a mixed model and could obtain p-values by using the lmerTest or afex packages. However due to heteroskedasticity (Levene Test) I also fit a robust model (rlmer command in the robustlmm package). Unfortunately lmerTest and afex do not work with rlmerMod objects. So I was looking for other ways to obtain p-values. Doing some online-research I found the recent publication by Geniole et al. (2019) and they used the Satterthwaite-approximated degrees of freedom generated by the lme4 model in combination with the output of the robustlmm model to obtain p-values for the robust model (see their Supplemental Material). As the the summary of the rlmer model gives me a t-value I could calculate the p-values for the robust model with the help of the Dfs from the non-robust model via the following formula: p.value.robust = 2*pt(abs(t.value.robust), Satterthwaithe.DF.non.robust, lower=FALSE) Is that a correct way to do this? Do you know other ways to calculate p-values for the robust model?

Normally I don't care about it and it is absorbed in the normalization of the path integral. But say that this propagator depends on a parameter, and I would like to actually keep this determinant. How do I actually compute it?I know I can do the trick $$(\det G)^{-1/2}=\exp(-\frac{1}{2}\text{Tr} \log G) $$ but then I would have to compute something like (after Wick rotating and going to momentum space) $$\int \frac{d^d k}{(2 \pi)^d} \log(\frac{1}{k^2+m^2})$$ which of course diverges (because I have infinitely many harmonic oscillators) and requires some kind of renormalization. Hence my question: how do you compute such a determinant?

Question:
When designing a REST API, is it common practice to include endpoints that allow you to see if potential resources exists in the database or not (before you eventually fetch them)? For instance, if I want to request product data using a fetch, should I check to see if the potential resource even exists in the database before fetching it, or should I just let the fetch API catch the error that a non-existent resource would produce? Is it even common to create endpoints that can be used to tell you if a resource exists in the database or not, or should this all be done through error handling on the proposed fetch itself?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","If you want to check for the existence of a resource but not retrieve it, you should be using HEAD . This method can be used for obtainingmetadata about the selected representation without transferring therepresentation data and is often used for testing hypertext links forvalidity, accessibility, and recent modification. There may be a good reason to make a separate endpoint (such as a client not having access to that verb and your not wanting to add verb tunneling support), but in the vast majority of cases a separate endpoint is unwarranted. It is common and not unreasonable for an API to expect clients to correctly handle a 404 error if the resource they're looking for does not exist. Most clients would prefer to save a roundtrip and handle the 404 rather than making a HEAD call first. If your clients want/need support for an existence check, you should add support for HEAD to your API and point clients to that verb.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/342623', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/263240/']}",jdg_283908

Question:
Say I have a very simple class like the following: class myClass:    def __init__(self):         self.myProp = 2 If I instantiate using the brackets , everything works as I expect: >>> a = myClass()>>> a.myProp2 However, if I don't use the brackets on the two lines above, i.e.: >>> a = myClass I get the following error: >>> a.myPropTraceback (most recent call last):File ""<pyshell#45>"", line 1, in <module>a.myPropAttributeError: class myClass has no attribute 'myProp' If I print the object, >>> a = myClass>>> a I get <class __main__.myClass at 0x0275C538> It seems that a is an instance of the class, but somehow is not initialized.In other languages, I would expect a compile error if trying to cast a class instance into an object without initalizing it (e.g. in C#, myClass a = new myClass(); would work fine but myClass a = new myClass; would return a compile error). So my question is: what is, technically speaking, the object a = myClass without brackets?

","a is the class itself -- In python, classes are first class objects 1 .  You can pass them around as parameters, alias them to different names (as you've done in your example) and then you can instances from any reference that you have in the current namespace. a = myClass  # a and myClass identical at this point.

Question:
Can someone help explain how can building a heap be O(n) complexity? Inserting an item into a heap is O(log n) , and the insert is repeated n/2 times (the remainder are leaves, and can't violate the heap property). So, this means the complexity should be O(n log n) , I would think. In other words, for each item we ""heapify"", it has the potential to have to filter down (i.e., sift down) once for each level for the heap so far (which is log n levels). What am I missing?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I think there are several questions buried in this topic: How do you implement buildHeap so it runs in O(n) time? How do you show that buildHeap runs in O(n) time when implemented correctly? Why doesn't that same logic work to make heap sort run in O(n) time rather than O(n log n) ? How do you implement buildHeap so it runs in O(n) time? Often, answers to these questions focus on the difference between siftUp and siftDown . Making the correct choice between siftUp and siftDown is critical to get O(n) performance for buildHeap , but does nothing to help one understand the difference between buildHeap and heapSort in general. Indeed, proper implementations of both buildHeap and heapSort will only use siftDown . The siftUp operation is only needed to perform inserts into an existing heap, so it would be used to implement a priority queue using a binary heap, for example. I've written this to describe how a max heap works. This is the type of heap typically used for heap sort or for a priority queue where higher values indicate higher priority. A min heap is also useful; for example, when retrieving items with integer keys in ascending order or strings in alphabetical order. The principles are exactly the same; simply switch the sort order. The heap property specifies that each node in a binary heap must be at least as large as both of its children. In particular, this implies that the largest item in the heap is at the root. Sifting down and sifting up are essentially the same operation in opposite directions: move an offending node until it satisfies the heap property: siftDown swaps a node that is too small with its largest child (thereby moving it down) until it is at least as large as both nodes below it. siftUp swaps a node that is too large with its parent (thereby moving it up) until it is no larger than the node above it. The number of operations required for siftDown and siftUp is proportional to the distance the node may have to move. For siftDown , it is the distance to the bottom of the tree, so siftDown is expensive for nodes at the top of the tree. With siftUp , the work is proportional to the distance to the top of the tree, so siftUp is expensive for nodes at the bottom of the tree. Although both operations are O(log n) in the worst case, in a heap, only one node is at the top whereas half the nodes lie in the bottom layer. So it shouldn't be too surprising that if we have to apply an operation to every node, we would prefer siftDown over siftUp . The buildHeap function takes an array of unsorted items and moves them until they all satisfy the heap property, thereby producing a valid heap. There are two approaches one might take for buildHeap using the siftUp and siftDown operations we've described. Start at the top of the heap (the beginning of the array) and call siftUp on each item. At each step, the previously sifted items (the items before the current item in the array) form a valid heap, and sifting the next item up places it into a valid position in the heap. After sifting up each node, all items satisfy the heap property. Or, go in the opposite direction: start at the end of the array and move backwards towards the front. At each iteration, you sift an item down until it is in the correct location. Which implementation for buildHeap is more efficient? Both of these solutions will produce a valid heap. Unsurprisingly, the more efficient one is the second operation that uses siftDown . Let h = log n represent the height of the heap. The work required for the siftDown approach is given by the sum (0 * n/2) + (1 * n/4) + (2 * n/8) + ... + (h * 1). Each term in the sum has the maximum distance a node at the given height will have to move (zero for the bottom layer, h for the root) multiplied by the number of nodes at that height. In contrast, the sum for calling siftUp on each node is (h * n/2) + ((h-1) * n/4) + ((h-2)*n/8) + ... + (0 * 1). It should be clear that the second sum is larger. The first term alone is hn/2 = 1/2 n log n , so this approach has complexity at best O(n log n) . How do we prove the sum for the siftDown approach is indeed O(n) ? One method (there are other analyses that also work) is to turn the finite sum into an infinite series and then use Taylor series. We may ignore the first term, which is zero: If you aren't sure why each of those steps works, here is a justification for the process in words: The terms are all positive, so the finite sum must be smaller than the infinite sum. The series is equal to a power series evaluated at x=1/2 . That power series is equal to (a constant times) the derivative of the Taylor series for f(x)=1/(1-x) . x=1/2 is within the interval of convergence of that Taylor series. Therefore, we can replace the Taylor series with 1/(1-x) , differentiate, and evaluate to find the value of the infinite series. Since the infinite sum is exactly n , we conclude that the finite sum is no larger, and is therefore, O(n) . Why does heap sort require O(n log n) time? If it is possible to run buildHeap in linear time, why does heap sort require O(n log n) time? Well, heap sort consists of two stages. First, we call buildHeap on the array, which requires O(n) time if implemented optimally. The next stage is to  repeatedly delete the largest item in the heap and put it at the end of the array. Because we delete an item from the heap, there is always an open spot just after the end of the heap where we can store the item. So heap sort achieves a sorted order by successively removing the next largest item and putting it into the array starting at the last position and moving towards the front. It is the complexity of this last part that dominates in heap sort. The loop looks likes this: for (i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {    arr[i] = deleteMax();} Clearly, the loop runs O(n) times ( n - 1 to be precise, the last item is already in place). The complexity of deleteMax for a heap is O(log n) . It is typically implemented by removing the root (the largest item left in the heap) and replacing it with the last item in the heap, which is a leaf, and therefore one of the smallest items. This new root will almost certainly violate the heap property, so you have to call siftDown until you move it back into an acceptable position. This also has the effect of moving the next largest item up to the root. Notice that, in contrast to buildHeap where for most of the nodes we are calling siftDown from the bottom of the tree, we are now calling siftDown from the top of the tree on each iteration! Although the tree is shrinking, it doesn't shrink fast enough : The height of the tree stays constant until you have removed the first half of the nodes (when you clear out the bottom layer completely). Then for the next quarter, the height is h - 1 . So the total work for this second stage is h*n/2 + (h-1)*n/4 + ... + 0 * 1. Notice the switch: now the zero work case corresponds to a single node and the h work case corresponds to half the nodes. This sum is O(n log n) just like the inefficient version of buildHeap that is implemented using siftUp. But in this case, we have no choice since we are trying to sort and we require the next largest item be removed next. In summary, the work for heap sort is the sum of the two stages: O(n) time for buildHeap and O(n log n) to remove each node in order , so the complexity is O(n log n) . You can prove (using some ideas from information theory) that for a comparison-based sort, O(n log n) is the best you could hope for anyway, so there's no reason to be disappointed by this or expect heap sort to achieve the O(n) time bound that buildHeap does.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 11, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/9755721', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/17614/']}",jdg_200751

Question:
In Javascript, the == comparison has a strict (non-type converting) version: === . Likewise, != has the strict form !== . These protect you from the following craziness: var s1 = ""1"",    i1 = 1,    i2 = 2;(s1 == i1)   // true, type conversion(s1 != i1)   // false, type conversion(s1 === i1)  // false, no type conversion(s1 !== i1)  // true, no type conversion However, the other comparison operators have no equivalent strict modes: (s1 < i2)   // true, type conversion(s1 <= i2)  // true, type conversion([] < i2)   // true, wait ... wat!? The obvious solution seems pretty verbose: ((typeof s1 === typeof i2) && (s1 < i2))  // false Is there a more idiomatic (or just less verbose) way to do this in Javascript?

Question:
Consider a massless rope with pulling forces applied at each end. How do we decide if tension is constant or not in a rope? Consider a few example scenarios: For example, if there is a knot in the rope the tension is not constant throughout (why?. Similarly, if the rope is hung over a cylindrical pulley of a non-negligible radius, the tension is not constant (why?). If there isn't anything touching the rope, for example, 2 people tugging on the rope at each end, the tension is constant (why?).

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","In a massless rope, tension is constant unless a force is applied somewhere along the rope. Why? Because any differential tension would travel at infinite velocity (since speed of wave scales inversely with square root of mass per unit length, and the rope is massless). The only way to preserve a difference is therefore applying a force along the rope (for example, running the rope over a pulley with friction ) putting some mass at a point along the rope, and accelerating that mass (because a net force is needed to accelerate the mass). When there is a knot in the rope, there will be friction between parts of the rope and that allows there to be different tension in different parts of the rope; but running the rope over a pulley does not imply that there is differential tension, unless the pulley is massive and accelerating, or unless there is friction. If you accept that the rope has finite diameter, then bending it in a curve may result in differential stresses along the diameter of the rope (the outside, being stretched more, would be under greater tension) but that depends on an assumption that the rope is solid and of finite size; when ropes are made out of twisted (or woven) filaments, these filaments can slide so as to maintain equal tension is all of them when the rope is bent. This is in fact a key reason for this construction (the other is that this ensures much greater flexibility - the two things go hand in hand).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/156413', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/63691/']}",jdg_262156

Question:
I am trying to create a function that throws an exception based on the type that you pass in. private void myFunc(Class<?> exceptionType) {   ...do some work...   throw new exceptionOfTypeExceptionTypePassedIn(newMessage);} Can you do this?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","First, the throw statement only works with reference expressions of Throwable or its subtypes. Therefore, the expression you pass to your throw must have that type. You can achieve this, by providing a bound for the exceptionType parameter. private void myFunc(Class<? extends Throwable> exceptionType) { If you now want to restrict the type of Throwable subtype, you can do that too. If it's Exception , you'll need a throws declaration private void myFunc(Class<? extends Exception> exceptionType) throws Exception { If it's RuntimeException , it won't private void myFunc(Class<? extends RuntimeException> exceptionType) { Depending on what you need, you might actually make the method generic. It would then look like this private <T extends Throwable> void myFunc(Class<T> exceptionType) throws T { As for the actual reflection logic, you are making the assumption that the corresponding type has an accessible constructor which accepts a String argument. If it doesn't, Java will throw all sorts of exceptions of its own. You need to handle these. A potential solution would look like this ( javadoc for Class#getConstructor , javadoc for Constructor#newInstance ) private <T extends Throwable> void myFunc(Class<T> exceptionType) throws T {    final String message = ""some message"";    try {        throw exceptionType.getConstructor(String.class).newInstance(message);    } catch (InstantiationException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        // rethrow    } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        // rethrow    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        // rethrow    } catch (InvocationTargetException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        // rethrow    } catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        // rethrow    } catch (SecurityException e) {        e.printStackTrace();        // rethrow    }} You can obviously collapse all those exception types into a multi-catch statement. Note that if the exception type you passed in was one of those mentioned in the existing catch statements, it will be swallowed, ie. not thrown. You can also add all those in a throws declaration of its own. private static <T extends Throwable> void myFunc(Class<T> exceptionType) throws InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException, IllegalArgumentException, InvocationTargetException, NoSuchMethodException, SecurityException, T {    final String message = ""some message"";    throw exceptionType.getConstructor(String.class).newInstance(message);} or rethrow the caught exceptions wrapped in a RuntimeException .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/33357887', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2063643/']}",jdg_215685

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","There's a little more to this than just saying: ""You didn't turn on the optimizer."" At least at a guess, you didn't (initially) turn on the optimizer in either case. Despite this, the C# version without optimization turned on ran almost as fast as the D version with optimization. Why would that be? The answer stems from the difference in compilation models. D does static compilation, so the source is translated to an executable containing machine code, which then executes. The only optimization that happens is whatever is done during that static compilation. C#, by contrast, translates from source code to MSIL, an intermediate language (i.e., basically a bytecode). That is then translated to machine language by the JIT compiler built into the CLR (common language runtime--Microsoft's virtual machine for MSIL). You can specify optimization when you run the C# compiler. That only controls optimization when doing the initial compilation from source to byte code. When you run the code, the JIT compiler does its thing--and it does its optimization whether you specify optimization in the initial translation from source to byte code or not. That's why you get much faster results with C# than with D when you didn't specify optimization with either one. I feel obliged to add, however, that both results you got (7 and 8 seconds for D and C# respectively) are really pretty lousy. A decent optimizer should recognize that the final output didn't depend on the loop at all, and based on that it should eliminate the loop completely. Just for comparison, I did (about) the most straightforward C++ translation I could: #include <iostream>#include <time.h>int main() {    long summer = 0;    auto start = clock();    for (long i = 0; i < 10000000000; i++)        summer++;    std::cout << double(clock() - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;} Compiled with VC++ using cl /O2b2 /GL , this consistently shows a time of 0.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/20822145', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/974992/']}",jdg_151590

","The proper way to do it is probably to break down the method by putting the try-catch block in a separate method, and use a return statement: public void someMethod() {    try {        ...        if (condition)            return;        ...    } catch (SomeException e) {        ...    }} If the code involves lots of local variables, you may also consider using a break from a labeled block, as suggested by Stephen C : label: try {    ...    if (condition)        break label;    ...} catch (SomeException e) {    ...}",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/6534072', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/367988/']}",jdg_288330

Question:
Any ideas as to how Apple implemented the ""slide to unlock"" (also, ""slide to power off"" is another identical example) animation? I thought about some sort of animating mask - but masking is not available on the iPhone OS for performance reasons. Is there some private API effect (like SuckEffect) that they might have used? A spotlight type of effect?  Some Core Animation thing? Edit:It's definitely not a series of stills.  I've seen examples of being edit a plist value or something and customize the string on jailbroken iphones.

",".concat creates a new Array.

","For someone who already has extensive experience in JSP/JEE and HTML/Javascript, GWT would take only half a day to understand. But it will take you two months to master. Here is a recommendation of the combination of technologies with GWT that I believe would make your enterprise level apps successful. I think you should use GWT because of its debuggability. But debuggability comes at a price. GWT debugging requires at least a quad core 8GB machine. If you don't find this to be true, it's probably because you have found a way to make your GWT UI small and simple. Eclipse is getting Hang while debugging GWT application RequiresResize, ProvidesResize and Layouts The first thing you need to master in GWT is the simple concept of layouts that are dictated by the interfaces RequiresResize, ProvidesResize. You need to ensure the chain of RequiresResize/ProvidesResize from the RootLayoutPanel down to the resizable widgets must be unbroken. And you need to master architectecting the flow of RequiresResize/ProvidesResize in your UI. Otherwise, when the browser is resized, you would see one or two odd hanging fruits that stick out unresizable. I think writing scheduled resizers for every widget rather than depending on Google's RequiresResize/ProvidesResize should be avoided at all cost. Otherwise, remember to debounce the resize over a few iterations. Too much trial/error for me to perfect the resizing. Async Async Async The next concept you need to accept ... I did not say ""you need to learn"", but ""you need to accept"" is async behaviour of Javascript and hence of GWT Java. It does not matter if you used GWT or not. You have to get used to inversion of control given to the callee to control the success response of the caller. You cannot write List<Persons> persons = server.getData(personId); You have to succumb to doing server.getData(personId, new Callback<Persons>(){  @override public void onSuccess(Person person){ ..... }  @override public void onFailure(Exception ex){ ..... }}); You cannot write boolean doOrNot = ConfirmDialogBox(); You have to write ConfirmDialogBox(new CloseHandler(){  public void onAccept(Person person){ ...}  public void onCancel(){ ... }}); GWT is Java but not Java I am amused by the constant existence of people who keep trying to use apache bytecode jars to compile with the GWT client, GWT client is Javascript written in Java. Binary Data and GWT GWT visual client The best combination that I find is GWT 2.4.0 with Sencha gxt 2.2.5. I avoid using the GXT-Uibinder project because I find that it places inconvenient restrictions on other combinations of 3rd party GWT frameworks. Particularly those frameworks that depend heavily on GWT.create() generator. GXT-Uibinder is a project outside of Sencha. GXT 2.2 and below requires me to write wrappers to make it usable with uibinder, because of my refusal to use the kludgy GXT-uibinder project. Wrappers are necessary because of one silly misalignment. Any class used as a parent widget node in uibinder must implement GWT HasWidgets, which requires implementing a method returning iterator<Widget> . Unfortunately, GXT 2.2-- already implements the iterator() method that returns the wrong genericized iterator. GXT 3 solves that problem. I think GXT 3 incorporates GXT-uibinder but you don't have to use it. You do not have to write much wrapping with GXT 3 (without using GXT-uibinder) to use it with uibinder. But I find that GXT 3 still has some quirky misbehaviour and trying to solve those quirks is just not worth my time. So I stick with GXT 2.2.5 until GXT 3 stabilises. I founded the google code project for wrapping SmartGWT (uibinding-smartgwt). SmartGWT is a very selfish fraemwork. My efforts often result in disaster if I try to mix it with GWT vanilla. It is due to some kinda of Z-indexing between the widgets of SmartClient and GWT. If you decide to use SmartGWT due to licensing concerns, you have to makes sure you use only SmartGWT and not with any other Widget provider. Not even GWT vanilla. And you highly probably would need to use my uibinding-smartgwt project. I am trying to enhance it to use some newer uibinder features and redefine the non-visual elements not to be widgets, but my current use of GXT is simply too involved and thinking about the two frameworks at the same time confuses me. Because they behave differently. Whereas GXT 3 seems to have made itself in complete alignment with GWT, SmartGWT has not demonstrated any effort to do so. Complete alignment between a 3rd party widget provider with GWT so that it implements GWT's interfaces smoothly is absolutely necessary to avoid wasting lots of time having to write kludges after kludges to solve some minor visual issues. Yes, especially the ProvidesResize/RequiresResize architecture. Don't ever use GWT incubation. Try them and then try to make your project maintainable, sustainable and enhanceable. Let's not even go there. Client-server communications Do not use GWT-RPC. DO NOT. Except for the convenience of learning GWT. RPC is good for simple apps whose role you have no intention of extending beyond the demo stage and barely usable stage. Programers who do not write distributed/sprawled out enterprise level apps probably would not agree with me. Unit testing is very helpful in developing your app. Forget about all those unit testing framework first. Just being able to write a simple routine to test each little feature without involving the huge gigantic picture of the app is very crucial. I just want to test that camelization loop to make it work, for example. GWT-RPC is an extreme inconvenience towards making your formal/informal unit testing. I am very attracted to using JAX-RS REST-RPC thro RestGWT on the GWT client side and RestEasy on the server side. I use JAX-B in conjunction with RestEasy's implementation of Jackson JSON processing. Instead of Resteasy, you could try using Jersey. In this way, I could use FireFox REST client to test the server independent of GWT. In fact, after starting your project using GWT on the client-side, you could extend your app to use non-GWT clients like JQuery as clients to the REST services. REST also makes it easy for you to write proxy/tunneling servers to let you overcome the SLD-SO-P (""2nd level domain, same origin"" policy) security restrictions of browsers. Whereas, the data format of GWT-RPC is deliberately undecipherable and unstable (I don't understand the Google engineer's mentality behind how this increases security, since you could still see bits and pieces of human readable text), I have not attempted to write a proxy to tunnel GWT-RPC services. I don't know how viable it is. http://h2g2java.blessedgeek.com/2011/11/gwt-with-jax-rs-aka-rpcrest-part-0.html . BTW, script-include to overcome sld-sop is very bad idea. Don't even think about it. Persistence Hibernate JPA for non-GAE.Eclipselink JPA for GAE with Google's MySQLDataNucleus JPA for GAE with Google data store. Initially, I bought into the idea of JDO. I tried so hard, and JDO keeps giving me conflicts. I gave up. Initially Google appeared to have been trying hard to persuade us that JDO is superior JPA. Whether it is true or not, I have failed to acquire skills to using JDO persistence so far. And since I have to program for non-GAE too, I don't want to contaminate my mind with the complexity of JDO. The reason I mentioned this is because I tend to use the same JPA POJO with the JAX-RS POJO. Which means, I've found that JPA, JAX-RS, JAXB and Jackson annotation mix into the same POJO-DTO with no conflicts. I often have one set of POJOs (with some exceptions) shared between GWT client, JAX_RS server and JPA persistence. To achieve that, you have to have one restriction - all DTOs must be GWT-serializable. Not just serializable. Avoid writing dto converters as much as possible. Waste of time having three different sets of POJO-DTOs and then having converters between them. MVP I find that MVP4G a very easy to manage MVP framework. The following discussion demonstrates how I use MVP4G: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/mvp4g/blessedgeek/mvp4g/T6r7egk-3Kk/Jz-dTqZDeMIJ MVP is a very helpful pattern. Because it helps me separate ""concerns"". When you are able to separate concerns, you are able to test and solve issues individually. It also helps you enhance/extend your project with as little interference/entanglement as possible from other concerns/modules of your labyrinth of applications. MVP4G also makes it easy to unit test, because you could simply mock a view or a presenter, or use a simplified eventbus/state-machine to debug only those parts you need to debug. And because of its modularity, you can easily avoid contamination of your non-test classes so that you could remove your test source trees without breaking your production classes. IOW, you don't have to modify your non-test classes to test them.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/11407650', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/496861/']}",jdg_332608

Question:
Reading through a Disk Defragmenter analysis report I noticed that my NTFS Master File Table was 6.87GB in size, but only 4% of it was reported as in use. Is this something that could cause NTFS performance issues? Is there anything that can be done about it?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","NTFS reserves 12.5% of the volume (it sounds like this is roughly a 54GB volume) for the MFT when the volume is formatted (unless you override this behaviour). This prevents MFT fragmentation. At 4% usage of your MFT, it sounds like you're not in any danger of causing NTFS to allocate additional space for the MFT. If the space allocated for the MFT is used up, NTFS will allocate additional space for the MFT. The ""Disk Defragmenter"" functionality in Windows XP and Windws Server 2003 (presumably also in newer versions of Windows) can defragment the MFT, so the spectre of MFT fragmentation that was a bigger deal in the NT 4.0 time-frame isn't such a big deal today.

Question:
I am going over my lecture notes in my Field theory class and I sawthis following statement without a proof: if $\mathrm{char}(F)=p>0$ then if $g(x)\in F[x]$ is irreduciblethen $g(x)$ have multiple roots iff $g'(x)=0$. I believe I can prove that if $g(x)$have multiple roots then $g'(x)=0$ but I am not sure and I am unableto prove that the converse is also true. My reasoning is as follows: $g(x)$ have multiple roots imply thereis an extension $K/F$ and $\alpha\in K$ s.t $g(\alpha)=g'(\alpha)=0$ (since if the multiplicity of $\alpha$ in $g(x)$ is $m>1$ (sinceit is not a simple root) then the multiplicity of $\alpha$ in $g'(x)$is at least $m-1\gt 0$). Since $g(x)$ is irreducible and we may assumeWLOG that $g(x)$ is monic then it follows that the minimal polynomialof $\alpha$ over $F$ is $g(x)$ , but $g'(\alpha)=0$ and if $g'\neq0$then $\deg(g')<\deg(g)$ and this is a contradiction. Is my argument correct, and how can I prove the converse ? help isappreciated!

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Your argument for necessity is correct. For sufficiency, if $g'(x)=0$ and $g(x)$ is irreducible, then it is not constant (constant polynomials are units, hence not irreducible by definition). If we write $g(x) = a_nx^n+ a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots + a_0$, with $n\gt 0$ and $a_n\neq 0$, then we conclude that for every $i$ such that $a_i\neq 0$, we must have $ia_i=0$; therefore, $i$ is a multiple of $p$. Thus, $g(x)$ is a polynomial in $x^p$. Therefore we have that $g(x) = a_0 + a_1x^p + \cdots +a_kx^{kp}$. Passing to an extension of $F$ where each coefficient is a $p$th power, if necessary, we can write $g(x)$ as$$\begin{align*}g(x) &= a_0 + a_1x^p + \cdots + a_kx^{kp}\\&= r_0^p + r_1^px^p + \cdots + r_k^px^{pk} \\&= (r_0 + r_1x + r_2x^2 + \cdots + r_kx^k)^p\end{align*}$$hence $g(x) = h(x)^p$ for some $h(x)$, and hence $g(x)$ must have repeated roots.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/172158', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/21335/']}",jdg_300093

Question:
I have some unclear situation: Will static singletons be garbage collected after last reference holding Activity has been destroyed? Because there is no more references in Application to singleton instance. Can I then rely on singletons? By official Android doc : There is normally no need to subclass Application. In most situation,  static singletons can provide the same functionality in a more modular  way. By some post: https://web.archive.org/web/20160729201921/http://www.devahead.com/blog/2011/06/extending-the-android-application-class-and-dealing-with-singleton/ While developing an application, I found  that sometimes some static variables bound to activities happened to  be uninitialized even though they’ve previously been initialized ! I  thought that when a static variable is initialized it stays so for the  entire life of the application, but this doesn’t seem to be the case. In another words, if nothing is holding a reference to my static singleton class, what's to prevent it from being garbage collected and destroyed?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","No, because if it's a singleton, it's stored as a static field in its class, and usually singletons are not destroyed by clients, ie you wouldn't put a static method deleteInstance() which sets the reference to null so that if nobody else uses it, it's eligible for garbage collection. For static fields, garbage collection will happen when the classloader which loaded the class is discarded. For this reason, the keyword static itself may cause memory leaks, if it references Activity objects, so you should be very careful when using it.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/13891186', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1039935/']}",jdg_223259

Question:
Today in the hadron physics tutorial we were talking about the Fabri-Picasso theorem where one step in the proof involves $\hat P |0\rangle$ which is the four-momentum operator on the vacuum. And from the notation I think that it is the non-interacting vacuum instead of the interacting vacuum $|\Omega\rangle$. So why is this the case? The first thought is that there are no particles and therefore nothing can carry a momentum. This seems a bit too easy as QFT knows vacuums that do interact. So $\hat P |\Omega\rangle$ could be non-zero, right? One argument that I came up with is the transformation behavior under Lorentz transformations. If the vacuum had a non-zero total momentum that would be a distinguished direction. Under a spatial rotation it would transform as a vector. But the vacuum has been a scalar under the Lorentz transformation, so it should be a scalar. And a scalar can only have zero three-momentum. Another idea I had was writing $\mathbf 1 = \sum_p | p \rangle\langle p|$ and applying that to the vacuum. The overlap $\langle p| 0 \rangle$ should be zero again as a state with a particle with a definite momentum should be orthogonal to the vacuum. We could not find a convincing argument which did not look like circular reasoning or a mere “vacuum is defined that way”. Defining the total momentum as the sum of the particle's momenta and then saying that the vacuum has particle number zero would do the trick. Is there some fundamental reason for the vacuum to have vanishing total momentum or is it just a matter of definition?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It's by definition. A vacuum state is defined to be Poincaré invariant, since it should not depend on the frame (in special relativistic QFT; you get frame-dependent vacua in QFT in curved spacetime). If it had non-zero momentum, it would not be invariant under rotations and boosts, for instance. For the non-interacting vacuum, you can also easily see this: The vacuum is by definition the state that gives zero when any annihilation operator is applied to it - it is the ""empty state"". The mode expansion of the momentum operator of a non-interacting theory is$$ P^\mu = \int \frac{\mathrm{d}^3 p}{(2\pi)^3}p^\mu a^\dagger(\vec p) a(\vec p)$$(for a scalar field, neglecting a vacuum energy term for $P^0$), and so applying this to the non-interacting vacuum gives zero since the $a(\vec p)$ just give zero when acting on $\lvert 0 \rangle$.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/228143', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/5705/']}",jdg_305083

Here's my .vimrc: set cursorlinehi CursorLine ctermbg=8 ctermfg=15 ""8 = dark gray, 15 = whitehi Cursor ctermbg=15 ctermfg=8 The problem I'm experiencing is that the current line background color covers up the cursor background color, so it looks like this: I can obviously tell where the cursor is because the foreground color is almost black, but when the cursor is on a space or at the beginning/end of a line I have no clue where it is unless I move it.

Question:
Background I am learning Go and I'm trying to do some JSON unmarshaling of a datetime. I have some JSON produced by a program I wrote in C, I am outputting what I thought was a valid ISO8601 / RFC3339 timezone offset. I'm using strftime with the following format string: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f%z (Note that %f is not supported by strftime natively, I have a wrapper that replaces it with the nanoseconds). This will then produce the following result: 2016-08-08T21:35:14.052975+0200 Unmarshaling this in Go however will not work: https://play.golang.org/p/vzOXbzAwdW package mainimport (    ""fmt""    ""time"")func main() {    t, err := time.Parse(time.RFC3339Nano, ""2016-08-08T21:35:14.052975+0200"")    if err != nil {        panic(err)    }    fmt.Println(t)} Output: panic: parsing time ""2016-08-08T21:35:14.052975+0200"" as ""2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999Z07:00"": cannot parse ""+0200"" as ""Z07:00"" (Working example: https://play.golang.org/p/5xcM0aHsSw ) This is because RFC3339 expects the timezone offset to be in the format 02:00 with a : , but strftime outputs it as 0200 . So I need to fix this in my C program to output the correct format. %z     The +hhmm or -hhmm numeric timezone (that is, the hour and              minute offset from UTC). (SU) Question However, now I have a bunch of JSON files with this incorrect format: 2016-08-08T21:35:14.052975+0200 instead of the correct (with the : in the timezone offset): 2016-08-08T21:35:14.052975+02:00 but I still want to be able to unmarshal it correctly in my Go program. Preferably two different JSON files with only this difference should parse in the exact same way. Regarding marshaling back to JSON, the correct format should be used. This is how I have defined it in my struct : Time            time.Time `json:""time""` So the question is, what is the ""Go"" way of doing this? Also in my code example I am using RFC3339Nano . How would I specify that in the metadata for the struct as well? As I have it now with just json:""time"" will that ignore the nano seconds?

Question : Anybody knows a closed-form expression for the fourth one? And will the Fermat prime p = 257 appear? (Or is this the law of small numbers again?) P.S. Strangely, the arguments of the logarithm can be expressed by the Dedekind eta function. Details in my blog . POSTSCRIPT : Thanks to Robert Israel's answer, I figured out how to extend it further. His answer (minus the imaginary part) can be expressed as, let, $\begin{aligned}x_1&=\tfrac{1}{2}(-1)^{1/8}\\x_2&=\tfrac{1}{2}(-1)^{7/8}\end{aligned}$ then, $\begin{aligned}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{\binom{8n}{4n}} &= \frac{256}{257}+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{x_1\arcsin(x_1)}{(1-x_1^2)^{3/2}}+\frac{x_2\arcsin(x_2)}{(1-x_2^2)^{3/2}}-\frac{x_1\rm arcsinh(x_1)}{(1+x_1^2)^{3/2}}-\frac{x_2\rm arcsinh(x_2)}{(1+x_2^2)^{3/2}} \right)\\ &= 0.985791\dots\end{aligned}$ (So the prime 257 does appear!) The form looked susceptible to a generalization so for the next level I tried, $\begin{aligned}u_1&=\tfrac{1}{2}(-1)^{1/16}\\u_2&=\tfrac{1}{2}(-1)^{3/16}\\u_3&=\tfrac{1}{2}(-1)^{13/16}\\u_4&=\tfrac{1}{2}(-1)^{15/16}\end{aligned}$ $\begin{aligned}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{(-1)^n}{\binom{16n}{8n}} &= \frac{65536}{65537}+\frac{1}{8}\left( \sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{u_k \arcsin(u_k)}{(1-u_k^2)^{3/2}}-\sum_{k=1}^4 \frac{u_k \rm arcsinh(u_k)}{(1+u_k^2)^{3/2}} \right)\\ &=0.999223\dots\end{aligned}$ which worked, and so on.

I can watch the request / response in Firebug and it looks like the source of the problem is that the resource in question returns different results depending on the Accept header.  Even though the docs say it should be set, in Firebug it shows up as "" / "" -- obviously, I want ""application/json"".  Is this a known bug?  Am I supposed to be setting some flag I'm not aware of? ETA: The request is cross-site, if that matters, but I'm passing a callback=? query parameter so JQuery is (successfully!) treating it as JSONP.  The service I'm calling in this particular case supports an accept override query parameter ( &accept=application/json ), so I got it to work manually, but I still consider the header screwup to be strange and was hoping I'd be able to fix it, so I don't run into this again when dealing with a different service that might not be so forgiving.  I don't have an easy way to copy/paste the code from my development environment but here's the gist: $.getJSON(baseURL + ""?item="" + itemNum + ""&callback=?"", function(data){  console.log(data);} As you can see, this is not exactly complex, and should (I'm 99% sure...) result in an XHR being sent with an Accept header of application/json .  Like I said, that's not happening, per Firebug's Net console.  If it matters, this is in Firefox 3.6.8. ETA Again: For anybody still reading this, yes, it's still happening, and no, I have no idea why.  Like I said, simple getJSON() call, really basic syntax, cross site, treated as JSONP because it includes a callback query parameter.  Still open to suggestions!

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","This is not a bug. Since your call is cross-domain, your browser will not allow you to make XHR calls (same-origin policy).  Internally, jQuery is working around this using the "" <script> tag hack"", to make the cross-domain call (this is the fundemental idea behind the JSONP data type).  Since the call is made using the  tag, it is simply not possible for jQuery to modify the accepts portion of the header. jQuery works its magic by hiding these details from you, but unfortunately in this case you seem to be subject to the Law of Leaky Abstractions .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3781343', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/26286/']}",jdg_247919

Question:
I have a few key-pairs, that are used as authentication, to ssh into my servers on the Amazon cloud. I rotate those certificates weekly, manually. My question is, I need to share the certificates with some colleagues, a few on the LAN, and a few in another part of the country. What is the best practice to share the certificate? My initial thoughts were Dropbox and email. We dont host dedicated email servers with encryption and all, and dont have a VPN. Thanks.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I doubt you're really using certificates for authentication.  Almost all non-password-based SSH authentication is done with public-private key pairs, but without certificates getting involved at all.  Before writing this Answer, I Googled, ""ssh certificates"", and the first 5 hits were from idiots erroneously referring to bare public keys (not certificates) as certificates. Here's how SSH authentication via public-private key pairs works: First, you generate a key pair. These are two cryptographically linked keys, where anything encrypted with one key can only be decrypted by the other, and vice-versa. One of the two keys in the pair is deemed the public key, and you don't care who sees it. In fact in most cases you WANT your public key to be published to the world, far and wide. The other key is deemed the private key, and you don't want anyone but you to get access to your private key. In the case of SSH authentication by public-private key pair, you put your public key in the authorized_keys file in your account on the server (in this case your Amazon EC2 instance), and the server allows anyone knowing the private key that's coupled to that public key to log into the server. Who cares if someone breaches your account on your Amazon EC2 instance and steals your public key? A public key doesn't allow them to log into anything as you, because knowing the public key doesn't allow them to know the private key, and you can't log into the account unless you have the private key that goes with the public key that's in the account. You only need to change your SSH public keys on your Amazon EC2 instance when your private key (on your own SSH client machine at home or at work) gets breached. If you need your cow-orkers to be able to log into the same accounts on your EC2 instances, have them send you their SSH public keys -- via any medium, no secrecy required, since these are just their public keys, not their private keys -- and append those public keys to the authorized_keys files in the accounts on your Amazon EC2 instances. Then, you can all log into those accounts and you can all keep your private keys completely private by never sending them anywhere.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://serverfault.com/questions/241513', 'https://serverfault.com', 'https://serverfault.com/users/57852/']}",jdg_309636

Question:
In my TitleScreen activity, I have... @Overridepublic boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event){   Log.d(""MyActivity"", ""in onTouchEvent!"");   MediaPlayer myplayer = MediaPlayer.create(TitleScreen.this, R.raw.mysound);   myplayer.start();   startActivity(new Intent(""com.example.GAME""));   return super.onTouchEvent(event);} This was causing the sound to play 3 times in rapid succession upon tapping the screen, making the sound I wanted to play have a delayed echo.  I checked the logs, and my ""in onTouchEvent!"" message was logged 3 times. This activity is just a static image for a title screen, and the idea is you tap it to start the next activity, and when you do so, the specified sound should player. For my particular issue, I was able to solve it by placing a global level int variable: private static int playerInstances = 0; and then wrapping my MediaPlayer lines with: if (playerInstances == 0){    MediaPlayer myplayer = MediaPlayer.create(TitleScreen.this, R.raw.critical1);    myplayer.start();    playerInstances++;} This insured that that code only executed once.  So my problem is solved.  I'm just wondering why I was getting onTouchEvent three times in one tap.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","What you can actually do on your onTouchEvent (better than using the static variable) is: @Overridepublic boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {   final int action = event.getAction();   if(action == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) {       Log.d(""MyActivity"", ""in onTouchEvent!"");       MediaPlayer myPlayer = MediaPlayer.create(TitleScreen.this, R.raw.mysound);       myPlayer.start();       startActivity(new Intent(""com.example.GAME""));   }   return super.onTouchEvent(event);}",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/11884969', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1044866/']}",jdg_301797

Question:
I'm trying to scope out what frequencies different common analog signals are. The DPScope design specs provides a list of common lower (sub 1 MHz) frequencies (copied below). audio (20 kHz) infrared remote control signals (38 kHz) ultrasound (200 kHz) servo signals (a few kHz) bio signals, medical instruments (< 100 Hz) I2C (1 MHz) RS-232 (115 kHz) one-wire SPI (as long as <= 1 MHz) However, some of those listed are used for transferring digital data (for example, RS-232). Now my questions: Under what situations would it be necessary to have a bandwidth capable of measuring these digital lines as analog signals? What important analog signals (or digital signals that should be tested as an analog signal) have higher frequencies than those listed above?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I assume ""as an analog signal"" means on an oscilloscope as opposed to a logic analyser. For a digital signal, it is important to be able to check the signal integrity and see whether it is subject to problems such as ringing, crosstalk, reflections, jitter, attenuation, etc. This can only be done with a scope with a bandwidth > the frequencies present in the signal - remember with a digital signal there are frequencies much higher than the fundamental present, how high is dictated by the rise time of the signal. For a 1MHz digital signal you would generally want at least a 5MHz bandwidth, preferably much higher. For debugging a typical small microcontroller (e.g. PIC, Atmel AVR, Arduino, etc) a scope bandwidth of at least 50MHz is preferable. This should be capable of handling just about all situations you might encounter. There are many signals above 1MHz that need checking, most microcontroller clock signals are > 1MHz, SPI is often > 1MHz, USB, etc. FPGA designs may run at 100s of MHz, high speed ADCs and DACs, etc. On a logic analyser all you can see is whether it is above a certain level or below a certain level (like a 1-bit scope) so while useful in other ways they are not suitable for checking signal integrity. The image below (taken on an MSO - Mixed Signal Oscillscope, a combination of a scope and logic analyser) is a good example of crosstalk causing problems and why a scope is needed to see what's really happening. Notice the waveforms are quite a way from the idea of a ""perfect"" digital signal: For the leftmost red arrow the second trace down is the transmitting trace, and the top trace down is the ""victim"" (receiving trace) and the right hand pulse they are reversed. We can see on the rise of the ""transmitting"" signal it causes a spike in the receiving trace, resulting in a unwanted glitch on the logic display, which is what the digital receiver would ""see"". In this image at the top we can see signal degradation caused by an incorrectly terminated trace, causing reflections. At the bottom we can see the same signal after it has been correctly terminated: On the logic analyser, both signals may work, but there is no way of knowing how marginal the first signal is without checking with a scope. The incorrectly terminated trace may only cause problems intermittently, so it's important to be able to check it's integrity. Looking at your link to the DPScope design, I see it's dsPIC based. It won't be comparable to anything you can buy (you can get a 20MHz analogue scope for << £50 nowadays, and a 5-10MHz DSO for similar) However, it would be a great project for educational purposes, and you will get something perfectly useable for low frequency (e.g. audio, UART, PWM) purposes. Plus you'll have fun building it. If your thinking of doing so, I'd say go for it, just don't expect it to take care of all your debugging needs. If your budget is limited, get a cheap analogue scope - you will generally get the highest bandwidth for your money. Remember the chicken and egg problem - you need a scope in order to build and test a scope ;-)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/36205', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/10658/']}",jdg_353697

Question:
It is well-known that the Church-Rosser property holds for $\beta \eta$-reduction in simply-typed lambda calculus. This implies that the calculus is consistent, in the sense that not all equations involving $\lambda$-terms are derivable: for example, K $\neq$ I , since they don't share the same normal form. It is also known that one can extend the result to pairs which correspond to product types. But I wonder if one can further extend the result for dependently typed lambda calculus (perhaps) with polymorphic types, e.g. the Calculus of Constructions? Any references would also be great!

","It might be useful to quickly give the counter-example to CR in typed calculi with $\beta$ and $\eta$: $$ t=\lambda x:A.(\lambda y:B.\ y)\ x$$ And we have$$ t\rightarrow_\beta \lambda x: A.x$$and$$ t\rightarrow_\eta \lambda y:B.y$$ It is immediate that if $A\equiv B$, then the two resulting terms are, in fact, $\alpha$ equivalent, but there is no reason for this to be the case, on untyped terms. On typed terms, it's pretty clear that $A$ has to be equal to $B$ for the resulting term $t$ to be well-typed. The big difficulty that occurs is this: For dependently typed systems, confluence needs to be proven before type preservation! This is because you need the property of $\Pi$-injectivity $$ \Pi x:A.B=_{\beta\eta}\Pi x:A'.B'\ \Leftrightarrow\ A=_{\beta\eta}A'\wedge B=_{\beta\eta} B'$$in order to prove inversion, which is required to prove preservation/subject reduction. So you can't even prove that $\beta\eta$-reductions preserve types without confluence, but confluence doesn't even hold on untyped/ill-typed terms! Breaking out of this vicious circle requires some technical tricks, which are hard to summarize here, but arguably the simplest to understand is to simply stop being interested in $\eta$-reductions, but instead concentrate on $\eta$-expansions : $t\rightarrow_{\eta*}\lambda x:A.t\ x$ Of course, you need to restrict this rule to non-$\lambda$ and non-applied terms to even hope to get termination, but with these restrictions it seems that the reduction behavior is much better behaved, and the meta-theory works out without too many problems. A good reference seems to be Neil Ghani, Eta-Expansions in Dependent Type Theory .

Question:
I have this extremely trivial piece of C code: static int arr[];int main(void) {    *arr = 4;    return 0;} I understand that the first statement is illegal (I've declared a file-scope array with static storage duration and file linkeage but no specified size), but why is it resulting in a linker error? : /usr/bin/ld: /tmp/cch9lPwA.o: in function `main':unit.c:(.text+0xd): undefined reference to `arr'collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status Shouldn't the compiler be able to catch this before the linker? It is also strange to me that, if I omit the static storage class, the compiler simply assumes array is of length 1 and produces no error beyond that: int arr[];int main(void) {    *arr = 4;    return 0;} Results in: unit.c:5:5: warning: array 'arr' assumed to have one element int arr[]; Why does omitting the storage class result in different behavior here and why does the first piece of code produce a linker error? Thanks.

","Empty arrays static int arr[]; and zero-length arrays static int arr[0]; were gcc non-standard extensions . The intention of these extensions were to act as a fix for the old ""struct hack"". Back in the C90 days, people wrote code such as this: typedef struct{  header stuff;  ...  int data[1]; // the ""struct hack""} protocol; where data would then be used as if it had variable size beyond the array depending on what's in the header part. Such code was buggy, wrote data to padding bytes and invoked array out-of-bounds undefined behavior in general. gcc fixed this problem by adding empty/zero arrays as a compiler extension, making the code behave without bugs, although it was no longer portable. The C standard committee recognized that this gcc feature was useful, so they added flexible array members to the C language in 1999. Since then, the gcc feature is to be regarded as obsolete, as using the C standard flexible array member is to prefer. As recognized by the linked gcc documentation: Declaring zero-length arrays in other contexts, including as interior members of structure objects or as non-member objects, is discouraged. And this is what your code does. Note that gcc with no compiler options passed defaults to -std=gnu90 (gcc < 5.0) or -std=gnu11 (gcc > 5.0). This gives you all the non-standard extensions enabled, so the program compiles but does not link. If you want standard compliant behavior, you must compile as gcc -std=c11 -pedantic-errors The -pedantic flag disables gcc extensions, and the linker error switches to a compiler error as expected. For an empty array as in your case, you get: error: array size missing in 'arr' And for a zero-length array you get: error: ISO C forbids zero-size array 'arr' [-Wpedantic] The reason why int arr[] works, is because this is an array declaration of tentative definition with external linkage (see C17 6.9.2). It is valid C and can be regarded as a forward declaration. It means that elsewhere in the code, the compiler (or rather the linker) should expect to find for example int arr[10] , which is then referring to the same variable. This way, arr can be used in the code before the size is known. (I wouldn't recommend using this language feature, as it is a form of ""spaghetti programming"".) When you use static you block the possibility to have the array size specified elsewhere, by forcing the variable to have internal linkage instead.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/52067353', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/5084841/']}",jdg_79295

Question:
I'm using React-router and it works fine while I'm clicking on link buttons, but when I refresh my webpage it does not load what I want. For instance, I am in localhost/joblist and everything is fine because I arrived here pressing a link. But if I refresh the webpage I get: Cannot GET /joblist By default, it didn't work like this. Initially I had my URL as localhost/#/ and localhost/#/joblist and they worked perfectly fine. But I don't like this kind of URL, so trying to erase that # , I wrote: Router.run(routes, Router.HistoryLocation, function (Handler) { React.render(<Handler/>, document.body);}); This problem does not happen with localhost/ , this one always returns what I want. This app is single-page, so /joblist doesn't need to ask anything to any server. My entire router. var routes = (    <Route name=""app"" path=""/"" handler={App}>        <Route name=""joblist"" path=""/joblist"" handler={JobList}/>        <DefaultRoute handler={Dashboard}/>        <NotFoundRoute handler={NotFound}/>    </Route>);Router.run(routes, Router.HistoryLocation, function (Handler) {  React.render(<Handler/>, document.body);});

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Server-side vs Client-side The first big thing to understand about this is that there are now 2 places where the URL is interpreted, whereas there used to be only 1 in 'the old days'. In the past, when life was simple, some user sent a request for http://example.com/about to the server, which inspected the path part of the URL, determined the user was requesting the about page, and then sent back that page. With client-side routing, which is what React Router provides, things are less simple. At first, the client does not have any JavaScript code loaded yet. So the very first request will always be to the server. That will then return a page that contains the needed script tags to load React and React Router, etc. Only when those scripts have loaded does phase 2 start. In phase 2, when the user clicks on the 'About us' navigation link, for example, the URL is changed locally only to http://example.com/about (made possible by the History API ), but no request to the server is made .  Instead, React Router does its thing on the client-side, determines which React view to render, and renders it. Assuming your about page does not need to make any REST calls, it's done already. You have transitioned from Home to About Us without any server request having fired. So basically when you click a link, some JavaScript runs that manipulates the URL in the address bar, without causing a page refresh , which in turn causes React Router to perform a page transition on the client-side . But now consider what happens if you copy-paste the URL in the address bar and e-mail it to a friend. Your friend has not loaded your website yet. In other words, she is still in phase 1 . No React Router is running on her machine yet. So her browser will make a server request to http://example.com/about . And this is where your trouble starts. Until now, you could get away with just placing a static HTML at the webroot of your server. But that would give 404 errors for all other URLs when requested from the server . Those same URLs work fine on the client-side , because there React Router is doing the routing for you, but they fail on the server-side unless you make your server understand them. Combining server- and client-side routing If you want the http://example.com/about URL to work on both the server- and the client-side, you need to set up routes for it on both the server- and the client-side. It makes sense, right? And this is where your choices begin. Solutions range from bypassing the problem altogether, via a catch-all route that returns the bootstrap HTML, to the full-on isomorphic approach where both the server and the client run the same JavaScript code. Bypassing the problem altogether: Hash History With Hash History , instead of Browser History , your URL for the about page would look something like this: http://example.com/#/about The part after the hash ( # ) symbol is not sent to the server. So the server only sees http://example.com/ and sends the index page as expected. React Router will pick up the #/about part and show the correct page. Downsides : 'ugly' URLs Server-side rendering is not possible with this approach. As far as search engine optimization (SEO) is concerned, your website consists of a single page with hardly any content on it. Catch-all With this approach, you do use the Browser History, but just set up a catch-all on the server that sends /* to index.html , effectively giving you much the same situation as with Hash History. You do have clean URLs however and you could improve upon this scheme later without having to invalidate all your user's favorites. Downsides : More complex to set up Still no good SEO Hybrid In the hybrid approach, you expand upon the catch-all scenario by adding specific scripts for specific routes. You could make some simple PHP scripts to return the most important pages of your site with content included, so Googlebot can at least see what's on your page. Downsides : Even more complex to set up Only good SEO for those routes you give the special treatment Duplicating code for rendering content on server and client Isomorphic What if we use Node.js as our server so we can run the same JavaScript code on both ends? Now, we have all our routes defined in a single react-router configuration and we don't need to duplicate our rendering code. This is 'the holy grail' so to speak. The server sends the exact same markup as we would end up with if the page transition had happened on the client. This solution is optimal in terms of SEO. Downsides : Server must (be able to) run JavaScript. I've experimented with Java in conjunction with Nashorn , but it's not working for me. In practice, it mostly means you must use a Node.js based server. Many tricky environmental issues (using window on server-side, etc.) Steep learning curve Which should I use? Choose the one that you can get away with. Personally, I think the catch-all is simple enough to set up, so that would be my minimum. This setup allows you to improve on things over time. If you are already using Node.js as your server platform, I'd definitely investigate doing an isomorphic app. Yes, it's tough at first, but once you get the hang of it it's actually a very elegant solution to the problem. So basically, for me, that would be the deciding factor. If my server runs on Node.js, I'd go isomorphic; otherwise, I would go for the Catch-all solution and just expand on it (Hybrid solution) as time progresses and SEO requirements demand it. If you'd like to learn more about isomorphic (also called 'universal') rendering with React, there are some good tutorials on the subject: React to the future with isomorphic apps The Pain and the Joy of creating isomorphic apps in ReactJS How to Implement Node + React Isomorphic JavaScript & Why it Matters Also, to get you started, I recommend looking at some starter kits. Pick one that matches your choices for the technology stack (remember, React is just the V in MVC , you need more stuff to build a full app). Start with looking at the one published by Facebook itself: Create React App Or pick one of the many by the community. There is a nice site now that tries to index all of them: Pick your perfect React starter project I started with these: React Isomorphic Starterkit React Redux Universal Hot Example Currently, I am using a homebrewed version of universal rendering that was inspired by the two starter kits above, but they are out of date now.

How to do conditional compilation in Python ? Is it using DEF ?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Python isn't compiled in the same sense as C or C++ or even Java, python files are compiled ""on the fly"", you can think of it as being similar to a interpreted language like Basic or Perl. 1 You can do something equivalent to conditional compile by just using an if statement. For example: if FLAG:    def f():        print ""Flag is set""else:    def f():        print ""Flag is not set"" You can do the same for the creation classes, setting of variables and pretty much everything. The closest way to mimic IFDEF would be to use the hasattr function. E.g.: if hasattr(aModule, 'FLAG'):    # do stuff if FLAG is defined in the current module. You could also use a try/except clause to catch name errors, but the idiomatic way would be to set a variable to None at the top of your script.

Question:
It seems that a List object cannot be stored in a List variable in C#, and can't even be explicitly cast that way.

List<string> sl = new List<string>();List<object> ol;ol = (List<object>)sl; results in Cannot convert type System.Collections.Generic.List<string> to System.Collections.Generic.List<object> Of course, you can do it by pulling everything out of the string list and putting it back in one at a time, but it is a rather convoluted solution.

","Think of it this way, if you were to do such a cast, and then add an object of type Foo to the list, the list of strings is no longer consistent.  If you were to iterate the first reference, you would get a class cast exception because once you hit the Foo instance, the Foo could not be converted to string! As a side note, I think it would be more significant whether or not you can do the reverse cast: List<object> ol = new List<object>();List<string> sl;sl = (List<string>)ol; I haven't used C# in a while, so I don't know if that is legal, but that sort of cast is actually (potentially) useful.  In this case, you are going from a more general class (object) to a more specific class (string) that extends from the general one.

","Verify that your code is bug free There's a saying among writers that ""All writing is re-writing"" -- that is, the greater part of writing is revising. For programmers (or at least data scientists) the expression could be re-phrased as ""All coding is debugging."" Any time you're writing code, you need to verify that it works as intended. The best method I've ever found for verifying correctness is to break your code into small segments, and verify that each segment works. This can be done by comparing the segment output to what you know to be the correct answer. This is called unit testing . Writing good unit tests is a key piece of becoming a good statistician/data scientist/machine learning expert/neural network practitioner. There is simply no substitute. You have to check that your code is free of bugs before you can tune network performance! Otherwise, you might as well be re-arranging deck chairs on the RMS Titanic . There are two features of neural networks that make verification even more important than for other types of machine learning or statistical models. Neural networks are not ""off-the-shelf"" algorithms in the way that random forest or logistic regression are. Even for simple, feed-forward networks, the onus is largely on the user to make numerous decisions about how the network is configured, connected, initialized and optimized. This means writing code, and writing code means debugging. Even when a neural network code executes without raising an exception, the network can still have bugs! These bugs might even be the insidious kind for which the network will train, but get stuck at a sub-optimal solution, or the resulting network does not have the desired architecture. ( This is an example of the difference between a syntactic and semantic error .) This Medium post, "" How to unit test machine learning code ,"" by Chase Roberts discusses unit-testing for machine learning models in more detail. I borrowed this example of buggy code from the article: def make_convnet(input_image):    net = slim.conv2d(input_image, 32, [11, 11], scope=""conv1_11x11"")    net = slim.conv2d(input_image, 64, [5, 5], scope=""conv2_5x5"")    net = slim.max_pool2d(net, [4, 4], stride=4, scope='pool1')    net = slim.conv2d(input_image, 64, [5, 5], scope=""conv3_5x5"")    net = slim.conv2d(input_image, 128, [3, 3], scope=""conv4_3x3"")    net = slim.max_pool2d(net, [2, 2], scope='pool2')    net = slim.conv2d(input_image, 128, [3, 3], scope=""conv5_3x3"")    net = slim.max_pool2d(net, [2, 2], scope='pool3')    net = slim.conv2d(input_image, 32, [1, 1], scope=""conv6_1x1"")    return net Do you see the error? Many of the different operations are not actually used because previous results are over-written with new variables. Using this block of code in a network will still train and the weights will update and the loss might even decrease -- but the code definitely isn't doing what was intended.  (The author is also inconsistent about using single- or double-quotes but that's purely stylistic.) The most common programming errors pertaining to neural networks are Variables are created but never used (usually because of copy-paste errors); Expressions for gradient updates are incorrect; Weight updates are not applied; Loss functions are not measured on the correct scale (for example, cross-entropy loss can be expressed in terms of probability or logits) The loss is not appropriate for the task (for example, using categorical cross-entropy loss for a regression task). Dropout is used during testing, instead of only being used for training. Make sure you're minimizing the loss function $L(x)$ , instead of minimizing $-L(x)$ . Make sure your loss is computed correctly . Unit testing is not just limited to the neural network itself. You need to test all of the steps that produce or transform data and feed into the network. Some common mistakes here are NA or NaN or Inf values in your data creating NA or NaN or Inf values in the output, and therefore in the loss function. Shuffling the labels independently from the samples (for instance, creating train/test splits for  the labels and samples separately); Accidentally assigning the training data as the testing data; When using a train/test split, the model references the original, non-split data instead of the training partition or the testing partition. Forgetting to scale the testing data; Scaling the testing data using the statistics of the test partition instead of the train partition; Forgetting to un-scale the predictions (e.g. pixel values are in [0,1] instead of [0, 255]). Here's an example of a question where the problem appears to be one of model configuration or hyperparameter choice, but actually the problem was a subtle bug in how gradients were computed. Is this drop in training accuracy due to a statistical or programming error? For the love of all that is good, scale your data The scale of the data can make an enormous difference on training. Sometimes, networks simply won't reduce the loss if the data isn't scaled. Other networks will decrease the loss, but only very slowly. Scaling the inputs (and certain times, the targets) can dramatically improve the network's training. Prior to presenting data to a neural network, standardizing the data to have 0 mean and unit variance, or to lie in a small interval like $[-0.5, 0.5]$ can improve training. This amounts to pre-conditioning, and removes the effect that a choice in units has on network weights. For example, length in millimeters and length in kilometers both represent the same concept, but are on different scales. The exact details of how to standardize the data depend on what your data look like. Data normalization and standardization in neural networks Why does $[0,1]$ scaling dramatically increase training time for feed forward ANN (1 hidden layer)? Batch or Layer normalization can improve network training. Both seek to improve the network by keeping a running mean and standard deviation for neurons' activations as the network trains. It is not well-understood why this helps training, and remains an active area of research. "" Understanding Batch Normalization "" by Johan Bjorck, Carla Gomes, Bart Selman "" Towards a Theoretical Understanding of Batch Normalization "" by Jonas Kohler, Hadi Daneshmand, Aurelien Lucchi, Ming Zhou, Klaus Neymeyr, Thomas Hofmann "" How Does Batch Normalization Help Optimization? (No, It Is Not About Internal Covariate Shift) "" by Shibani Santurkar, Dimitris Tsipras, Andrew Ilyas, Aleksander Madry Crawl Before You Walk; Walk Before You Run Wide and deep neural networks, and neural networks with exotic wiring, are the Hot Thing right now in machine learning. But these networks didn't spring fully-formed into existence; their designers built up to them from smaller units. First, build a small network with a single hidden layer and verify that it works correctly. Then incrementally add additional model complexity, and verify that each of those works as well. Too few neurons in a layer can restrict the representation that the network learns, causing under-fitting. Too many neurons can cause over-fitting because the network will ""memorize"" the training data. Even if you can prove that there is, mathematically, only a small number of neurons necessary to model a problem, it is often the case that having ""a few more"" neurons makes it easier for the optimizer to find a ""good"" configuration. (But I don't think anyone fully understands why this is the case.) I provide an example of this in the context of the XOR problem here: Aren't my iterations needed to train NN for XOR with MSE < 0.001 too high? . Choosing the number of hidden layers lets the network learn an abstraction from the raw data. Deep learning is all the rage these days, and networks with a large number of layers have shown impressive results. But adding too many hidden layers can make risk overfitting or make it very hard to optimize the network. Choosing a clever network wiring can do a lot of the work for you. Is your data source amenable to specialized network architectures? Convolutional neural networks can achieve impressive results on ""structured"" data sources, image or audio data. Recurrent neural networks can do well on sequential data types, such as natural language or time series data. Residual connections can improve deep feed-forward networks. Neural Network Training Is Like Lock Picking To achieve state of the art, or even merely good, results, you have to set up all of the parts configured to work well together . Setting up a neural network configuration that actually learns is a lot like picking a lock: all of the pieces have to be lined up just right. Just as it is not sufficient to have a single tumbler in the right place, neither is it sufficient to have only the architecture, or only the optimizer, set up correctly. Tuning configuration choices is not really as simple as saying that one kind of configuration choice (e.g. learning rate) is more or less important than another (e.g. number of units), since all of these choices interact with all of the other choices, so one choice can do well in combination with another choice made elsewhere . This is a non-exhaustive list of the configuration options which are not also regularization options or numerical optimization options. All of these topics are active areas of research. The network initialization is often overlooked as a source of neural network bugs. Initialization over too-large an interval can set initial weights too large, meaning that single neurons have an outsize influence over the network behavior. The key difference between a neural network and a regression model is that a neural network is a composition of many nonlinear functions, called activation functions . (See: What is the essential difference between neural network and linear regression ) Classical neural network results focused on sigmoidal activation functions (logistic or $\tanh$ functions). A recent result has found that ReLU (or similar) units tend to work better because the have steeper gradients, so updates can be applied quickly. (See: Why do we use ReLU in neural networks and how do we use it? ) One caution about ReLUs is the ""dead neuron"" phenomenon, which can stymie learning; leaky relus and similar variants avoid this problem. See Why can't a single ReLU learn a ReLU? My ReLU network fails to launch There are a number of other options. See: Comprehensive list of activation functions in neural networks with pros/cons Residual connections are a neat development that can make it easier to train neural networks. ""Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"" Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun In: CVPR. (2016). Additionally, changing the order of operations within the residual block can further improve the resulting network. "" Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks "" by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun. Non-convex optimization is hard The objective function of a neural network is only convex when there are no hidden units, all activations are linear, and the design matrix is full-rank -- because this configuration is identically an ordinary regression problem. In all other cases, the optimization problem is non-convex, and non-convex optimization is hard. The challenges of training neural networks are well-known (see: Why is it hard to train deep neural networks? ). Additionally, neural networks have a very large number of parameters, which restricts us to solely first-order methods (see: Why is Newton's method not widely used in machine learning? ). This is a very active area of research. Setting the learning rate too large will cause the optimization to diverge, because you will leap from one side of the ""canyon"" to the other. Setting this too small will prevent you from making any real progress, and possibly allow the noise inherent in SGD to overwhelm your gradient estimates. See: How can change in cost function be positive? Gradient clipping re-scales the norm of the gradient if it's above some threshold. I used to think that this was a set-and-forget parameter, typically at 1.0, but I found that I could make an LSTM language model dramatically better by setting it to 0.25. I don't know why that is. Learning rate scheduling can decrease the learning rate over the course of training. In my experience, trying to use scheduling is a lot like regex : it replaces one problem (""How do I get learning to continue after a certain epoch?"") with two problems (""How do I get learning to continue after a certain epoch?"" and ""How do I choose a good schedule?""). Other people insist that scheduling is essential. I'll let you decide. Choosing a good minibatch size can influence the learning process indirectly, since a larger mini-batch will tend to have a smaller variance ( law-of-large-numbers ) than a smaller mini-batch. You want the mini-batch to be large enough to be informative about the direction of the gradient, but small enough that SGD can regularize your network. There are a number of variants on stochastic gradient descent which use momentum, adaptive learning rates, Nesterov updates and so on to improve upon vanilla SGD. Designing a better optimizer is very much an active area of research. Some examples: No change in accuracy using Adam Optimizer when SGD works fine How does the Adam method of stochastic gradient descent work? Why does momentum escape from a saddle point in this famous image? When it first came out, the Adam optimizer generated a lot of interest. But some recent research has found that SGD with momentum can out-perform adaptive gradient methods for neural networks. "" The Marginal Value of Adaptive Gradient Methods in Machine Learning "" by Ashia C. Wilson, Rebecca Roelofs, Mitchell Stern, Nathan Srebro, Benjamin Recht But on the other hand, this very recent paper proposes a new adaptive learning-rate optimizer which supposedly closes the gap between adaptive-rate methods and SGD with momentum. "" Closing the Generalization Gap of Adaptive Gradient Methods in Training Deep Neural Networks "" by Jinghui Chen, Quanquan Gu Adaptive gradient methods, which adopt historical gradient information to automatically adjust the learning rate, have been observed to generalize worse than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with momentum in training deep neural networks. This leaves how to close the generalization gap of adaptive gradient methods an open problem. In this work, we show that adaptive gradient methods such as Adam, Amsgrad, are sometimes ""over adapted"". We design a new algorithm, called Partially adaptive momentum estimation method (Padam), which unifies the Adam/Amsgrad with SGD to achieve the best from both worlds. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that Padam can maintain fast convergence rate as Adam/Amsgrad while generalizing as well as SGD in training deep neural networks. These results would suggest practitioners pick up adaptive gradient methods once again for faster training of deep neural networks. Specifically for triplet-loss models, there are a number of tricks which can improve training time and generalization. See: In training a triplet network, I first have a solid drop in loss, but eventually the loss slowly but consistently increases. What could cause this? Regularization Choosing and tuning network regularization is a key part of building a model that generalizes well (that is, a model that is not overfit to the training data). However, at the time that your network is struggling to decrease the loss on the training data -- when the network is not learning -- regularization can obscure what the problem is. When my network doesn't learn, I turn off all regularization and verify that the non-regularized network works correctly. Then I add each regularization piece back, and verify that each of those works along the way. This tactic can pinpoint where some regularization might be poorly set. Some examples are $L^2$ regularization (aka weight decay) or $L^1$ regularization is set too large, so the weights can't move. Two parts of regularization are in conflict. For example, it's widely observed that layer normalization and dropout are difficult to use together. Since either on its own is very useful, understanding how to use both is an active area of research. "" Understanding the Disharmony between Dropout and Batch Normalization by Variance Shift "" by Xiang Li, Shuo Chen, Xiaolin Hu, Jian Yang "" Adjusting for Dropout Variance in Batch Normalization and Weight Initialization "" by Dan Hendrycks, Kevin Gimpel. "" Self-Normalizing Neural Networks "" by Günter Klambauer, Thomas Unterthiner, Andreas Mayr and Sepp Hochreiter Keep a Logbook of Experiments When I set up a neural network, I don't hard-code any parameter settings. Instead, I do that in a configuration file (e.g., JSON) that is read and used to populate network configuration details at runtime. I keep all of these configuration files. If I make any parameter modification, I make a new configuration file. Finally, I append as comments all of the per-epoch losses for training and validation. The reason that I'm so obsessive about retaining old results is that this makes it very easy to go back and review previous experiments. It also hedges against mistakenly repeating the same dead-end experiment. Psychologically, it also lets you look back and observe ""Well, the project might not be where I want it to be today, but I am making progress compared to where I was $k$ weeks ago."" As an example, I wanted to learn about LSTM language models, so I decided to make a Twitter bot that writes new tweets in response to other Twitter users. I worked on this in my free time, between grad school and my job. It took about a year, and I iterated over about 150 different models before getting to a model that did what I wanted: generate new English-language text that (sort of) makes sense. (One key sticking point, and part of the reason that it took so many attempts, is that it was not sufficient to simply get a low out-of-sample loss, since early low-loss models had managed to memorize the training data, so it was just reproducing germane blocks of text verbatim in reply to prompts -- it took some tweaking to make the model more spontaneous and still have low loss.)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 10, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/352036', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/22311/']}",jdg_176717

Question:
Though IPv6 is not here yet it one day we will all lose our familiar IPv4 addresses and be communicating over the internet solely with IPv6 addresses. What interests me is the implications this has for those who scan the internet hunting for common vulnerabilities. At the moment a common method for internet worms is to scan the subnet upon which they lie (they infect a machine on 80.7.2.4 so they scan all IPs at 80.7.*.* , maybe expanding out to 80.*.*.* ). Whilst it's still non-trivial to 'scan the entire internet', scanning 1/255th is completely feasible. What I would like to know is will this still make sense when we are all running on IPv6 addresses? We will be moving from 4,294,967,296 addresses to 340,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses. Will it be anywhere near as simple for these worms to scan their 'neighbourhood'? Or will network nodes be so sparsely distributed that an IPv6 address becomes a commodity in itself?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","People who scan the internet will have to find a different source of addresses than just sequential enumeration. Search engines provide a great database of in-use hostnames and addresses, as does DNS. Scanning the neighborhood might be feasible, but that depends on the neighborhood. In a subnet where DHCPv6 is being used, you can still scan other addresses, since DHCP servers typically assign addresses sequentially from a pool. If autoconfiguration (SLAAC) is used, it becomes harder. If you know what hardware to look for, you know 40 of the 64 hostbits (24 bits vendor ID + 16 bits fixed 0xfffe), and you need to brute-force 24 bits. That is doable. If privacy extensions are in use, you can still look for SLAAC addresses since a host using privacy extensions has both his SLAAC address and his privacy address. On server networks, most hosts will be numbered sequentially, using funny words (b00b, babe) or based on info like VLAN number or IPv4 address. These are all enumerable. So, to sum it up, you can't scan the whole internet, but you can partially smart-scan networks.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/7880', 'https://security.stackexchange.com', 'https://security.stackexchange.com/users/1363/']}",jdg_140853

Question:
I am trying to start a new document based Cocoa project in Swift and want to create a subclass of NSWindowController (as recommended in Apple's guides on document based apps). In ObjC you would make an instance of an NSWindowController subclass sending the initWithWindowNibName: message, which was implemented accordingly, calling the superclasses method. In Swift init(windowNibName) is only available as an convenience initializer, the designated initializer of NSWindowController is init(window) which obviously wants me to pass in a window. I cannot call super.init(windowNibName) from my subclass, because it is not the designated initializer, so I obviously have to implement convenience init(windowNibName) , which in turn needs to call self.init(window) . But if all I have is my nib file, how do I access the nib file's window to send to that initializer?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You need to override either all three designated initializers of NSWindowController ( init() , init(window) and init(coder) ), or none of them, in which case your subclass will automatically inherit init(windowNibName) and all others convenience initializers and you will be able to construct it using superclass's convenience initializer: // this overrides none of designated initializersclass MyWindowController: NSWindowController {    override func windowDidLoad() {        super.windowDidLoad()    }}// this one overrides all of them//// Awkwardly enough, I see only two initializers // when viewing `NSWindowController` source from Xcode, // but I have to also override `init()` to make these rules apply.// Seems like a bug.class MyWindowController: NSWindowController{    init()    {        super.init()    }    init(window: NSWindow!)    {        super.init(window: window)    }    init(coder: NSCoder!)    {        super.init(coder: coder)    }    override func windowDidLoad() {        super.windowDidLoad()    }}// this will work with either of the abovelet mwc: MyWindowController! = MyWindowController(windowNibName: ""MyWindow"") This is covered by ""Initialization / Automatic Initializer Inheritance"" in the language guide: However, superclass initializers are automatically inherited if certain conditions are met.

Question:
I'm in the process of doing some advance IE8 testing, and it seems that the old technique of using margin: 0 auto; doesn't work in all cases in IE8. The following piece of HTML gives a centered button in FF3, Opera, Safari, Chrome, IE7, and IE8 compat, but NOT in IE8 standard: <div style=""height: 500px; width: 500px; background-color: Yellow;"">    <input type=""submit"" style=""display: block; margin: 0 auto;"" /></div> (As a work-around I can add an explicit width to the button). So the question is: which browsers are correct? Or is this one of those cases where the behaviour is undefined? (My thinking is that all the browsers are incorrect - shouldn't the button be 100% width if it's ""display: block""?) UPDATE: I'm being a dunce. Since input isn't a block-level element, I should have just contained it within a div with ""text-align: center"". Having said that, for curiosity's sake, I'd still like to know whether the button should or shouldn't be centered in the example above. FOR THE BOUNTY: I know I'm doing odd things in the example, and as I point out in the update, I should have just aligned it center. For the bounty, I'd like references to the specs that answer: If I set ""display: block"", shouldthe button be width 100%? Or is thisundefined? Since the display is block, should""margin: 0 auto;"" center the button, ornot, or undefined?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It is a bug in IE8. Starting with your second question:  “margin: 0 auto” centers a block, but only when width of the block is set to be less that width of parent. Usually, they get to be the same. That is why text in the example below is not centered. <div style=""height: 100px; width: 500px; background-color: Yellow;"">        <b style=""display: block; margin: 0 auto; "">text</b></div> Once the display style of the b element is set to block, its width defaults to the parents width. CSS spec 10.3.3 Block-level, non-replaced elements in normal flow describes how: “If 'width' is set to 'auto', any other 'auto' values become '0' and 'width' follows from the resulting equality.” The equality mentioned there is 'margin-left' + 'border-left-width' + 'padding-left' + 'width' + 'padding-right' + 'border-right-width' + 'margin-right' = width of containing block So, normally all autos result in a block width being equal to the width of containing block. However, this calculation should not be applied to INPUT, which is a replaced element. Replaced elements are covered by 10.3.4 Block-level, replaced elements in normal flow . Text there says: “The used value of 'width' is determined as for inline replaced elements.” The relevant part of 10.3.2 Inline, replaced elements is: “if 'width' has a computed value of 'auto', and the element has an intrinsic width, then that intrinsic width is the used value of 'width'”.

I installed supervisor on ubuntu server 16.04. $ sudo apt-get install supervisor$ sudo update-rc.d supervisor defaults After rebooting, supervisor didn't get started automatically.

What do I need to check to get it fixed?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I am convinced that this issue is a packaging bug in the Supervisor package in Ubuntu 16.04 and it seems to have been caused by the switch to systemd: This issue was already reported upstream on the Supervisor project's issue tracker (where nothing can be fixed) in issue 735 . I was bitten by this issue a few days ago and was astonished to find that this issue was never reported to the package maintainers, even though Ubuntu 16.04 was released quite a while ago and this breaks backwards compatibility and expected behavior. This is why I decided to report this issue to the package maintainers in bug 1594740 . I documented a simple workaround in bug 1594740 that doesn't require any configuration files to be created - you just need to enable and start the Supervisor daemon after installation of the package: # Make sure Supervisor comes up after a reboot.sudo systemctl enable supervisor# Bring Supervisor up right now.sudo systemctl start supervisor I'm not so sure that this will be fixed in Ubuntu 16.04 but at least now there's a central place to gather complaints and document workarounds (in bug 1594740 , not in issue 735 ). If anyone was bitten by this issue, consider voicing your concern in bug 1594740 to convince the package maintainers to fix this issue. Thanks!

Question:
Let $p$ be a prime and let $M$ be an $n \times m$ matrix with integer entries such that $M\vec{v} \not\equiv \vec{0} \text{ (mod }p\text{)}$ for any column vector $\vec{v} \neq \vec{0}$ whose entries are $0$ or $1$. Is there a row vector $\vec{x}$ with integer entries such that no entry of $\vec{x}M$ is $0 \text{ (mod }p\text{)}$?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It seems that my previous answer was completely wrong, and that the fact is true for all nonzero integer (not necessarily prime) $p$. Let $M=[m_{ij}]_{i\leq n,\;j\leq m}$. If there is no $x$ satisfying the requirements (we regard all entries as integers, not residues!), then one of the sums of the form $\sum_{i\leq n} m_{ij}x_i$, $j\leq m$, is divisible by $p$ for every integer vector $x$. Equivalently,$$   \prod_{j\leq m}\left(1-\exp\left(\frac{2\pi i}p\sum_{i\leq n} m_{ij}x_i\right)\right)=0$$for every integral vector $x$. After expanding all the brackets, we get the equality of the form$$  \sum_k c_k\xi_{1k}^{x_1}\dots \xi_{nk}^{x_n}=0,$$where $c_i$ are some (integer) numbers, and $\xi_{ik}$ are some nonzero complex numbers; after collecting terms, we may assume that all the $n$-tuples $(\xi_{1k},\dots,\xi_{nk})$ are distinct. Due to the usual Vandermonde argument, this may happen only if $c_k=0$ for all $k$. This means, in particulat, that the term $1^m$ cancels with some other term, which has the form$$  (-1)^t\prod_{j\in T}\exp\left(\frac{2\pi i}p\sum_{i\leq n} m_{ij}x_i\right)  =(-1)^t\prod_{i\leq n}\left(\exp\left(\frac{2\pi i}p\sum_{j\in T}m_{ij}\right)\right)^{x_i}.$$for some $\varnothing\neq T\subseteq \{1,2,\dots,m\}$ with $t=|T|$. This yields that $\sum_{j\in T}m_{ij}$ is divisible by $p$ for all $i\leq n$, so the characteristic column of $T$ (taken as $v$) violates the condition imposed on $M$. Moreover, one may notice that there is such $T$ with odd cardinality; so we have proved that $v$ may be chosen with odd number of ones in it. ADDENDUM. The `usual Vandermonde argument' I meant consists in the following. Assume that $(\xi_{1,k},\dots,\xi_{n,k})$, $k=1,\dots,K$, are distinct tuples of complex numbers. Then the arrangements $(\xi_{1,k}^{x_1}\cdots\xi_{n,k}^{x_n})_{x_i\in\mathbb Z}$ are linearly independent. The proof goes by the induction on $n$; the base case $n=1$ is classical Vandermonde. For the step of induction, assume the linear dependence, collect the terms with identical $\xi_{1,k}$ and apply first the hypothesis (to prove that one of the coefficients of $\xi_{1,k}^{x_i}$ does not vanish for some choice of $x_2,\dots,x_n$) and then the base to finish the step.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/251835', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/99127/']}",jdg_78776

It is order of increasing complexity? Yury Manin: Order of increasing complexity. They are non-computable. In a manner (nontrivial) it is the strongest noncomputable.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Answer from Yury I. Manin: 1) I understand  (semi)computable functions as (partially) recursive functions; so arguments and values are from the start natural numbers. But they can be also rational numbers, finite words in a finite alphabet and a lot more: cf. Chapter V of [1], and also pages 285-296 there. 2) The exponential Kolmogorov complexity of a number (or of a semicomputable function) is the first time that it appears in an optimal universal program: see pp. 223-234 of [1]. It is ""almost"", but not quite computable: it is the infimum of a sequence of computable functions. In this sense KC lies ""at the boundary"" between computable and uncomputable. 3) If an oracle  orders all natural numbers in the order of growing Kolmogorov complexity, then all semi-computable functions  become of no more than linear growth (of course, if their values are also so ordered). So KC ""simplifies"" all semicomputable functions simultaneously. In this sense, probably, I should have said that KC has ""the least complex uncomputability"", rather than ""the most complex"", sorry. 4) In [2], one can find applications of this notion that were quite unexpected for me, and that I have understood pretty recently.

","Your search indeed will never return useful results, because you told the search engine you only want to search for answers by setting is:answer .

","You are correct that the condition that $a=b$ if and only if $\alpha_s = \beta_s$ for all $s \in S$ is required. This is wrapped up in definition of a 'formal sum', so I don't think there's any reason why you'd need to spell it out explicitly. If you wanted to be extremely precise, you could say that the underlying set of $FS$ is the set of functions $a : S \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $\alpha(s) = 0$ for all but finitely many $s \in S$. Writing $\alpha_s = a(s)$ and $\beta_s = b(s)$, the condition that $a=b$ if and only if $\alpha_s=\beta_s$ for all $s \in S$ now follows from the definition of a function, and then you can simply identify the formal sum $a = \sum_{s \in S} \alpha_s s$ with the corresponding function $a : S \to \mathbb{R}$.

Question:
I'm writing python 2.6.6 code on windows that looks like this: try:    dostuff()except KeyboardInterrupt:    print ""Interrupted!""except:    print ""Some other exception?""finally:    print ""cleaning up....""    print ""done."" dostuff() is a function that loops forever, reading a line at a time from an input stream and acting on it. I want to be able to stop it and clean up when I hit ctrl-c. What's happening instead is that the code under except KeyboardInterrupt: isn't running at all. The only thing that gets printed is ""cleaning up..."", and then a traceback is printed that looks like this: Traceback (most recent call last):  File ""filename.py"", line 119, in <module>    print 'cleaning up...'KeyboardInterrupt So, exception handling code is NOT running, and the traceback claims that a KeyboardInterrupt occurred during the finally clause , which doesn't make sense because hitting ctrl-c is what caused that part to run in the first place! Even the generic except: clause isn't running. EDIT: Based on the comments, I replaced the contents of the try: block with sys.stdin.read(). The problem still occurs exactly as described, with the first line of the finally: block running and then printing the same traceback. EDIT #2: If I add pretty much anything after the read, the handler works. So, this fails: try:    sys.stdin.read()except KeyboardInterrupt:    ... But this works: try:    sys.stdin.read()    print ""Done reading.""except KeyboardInterrupt:    ... Here's what's printed: Done reading. Interrupted!cleaning up...done. So, for some reason, the ""Done reading."" line is printed, even though the exception occurred on the previous line. That's not really a problem - obviously I have to be able to handle an exception anywhere inside the ""try"" block. However, the print doesn't work normally - it doesn't print a newline afterwards like it's supposed to! The ""Interruped"" is printed on the same line... with a space before it, for some reason...? Anyway, after that the code does what it's supposed to. It seems to me that this is a bug in handling an interrupt during a blocked system call.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Asynchronous exception handling is unfortunately not reliable (exceptions raised by signal handlers, outside contexts via C API, etc).  You can increase your chances of handling the async exception properly if there is some coordination in the code about what piece of code is responsible for catching them (highest possible in the call stack seems appropriate except for very critical functions). The called function ( dostuff ) or functions further down the stack may itself have a catch for KeyboardInterrupt or BaseException that you didn't/couldn't account for. This trivial case worked just fine with python 2.6.6 (x64) interactive + Windows 7 (64bit): >>> import time>>> def foo():...     try:...             time.sleep(100)...     except KeyboardInterrupt:...             print ""INTERRUPTED!""...>>> foo()INTERRUPTED!  #after pressing ctrl+c EDIT: Upon further investigation, I tried what I believe is the example that others have used to reproduce the issue.  I was lazy so I left out the ""finally"" >>> def foo():...     try:...             sys.stdin.read()...     except KeyboardInterrupt:...             print ""BLAH""...>>> foo() This returns immediately after hitting CTRL+C.  The interesting thing happened when I immediately tried to call foo again: >>> foo()Traceback (most recent call last):  File ""c:\Python26\lib\encodings\cp437.py"", line 14, in decode    def decode(self,input,errors='strict'):KeyboardInterrupt The exception was raised immediately without me hitting CTRL+C. This would seem to make sense - it appears that we are dealing with nuances in how asynchronous exceptions are handled in Python.  It can take several bytecode instructions before the async exception is actually popped and then raised within the current execution context.  (That's the behavior that I've seen when playing with it in the past) See the C API: http://docs.python.org/c-api/init.html#PyThreadState_SetAsyncExc So this somewhat explains why KeyboardInterrupt gets raised in the context of the execution of the finally statement in this example: >>> def foo():...     try:...             sys.stdin.read()...     except KeyboardInterrupt:...             print ""interrupt""...     finally:...             print ""FINALLY""...>>> foo()FINALLYTraceback (most recent call last):  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>  File ""<stdin>"", line 7, in fooKeyboardInterrupt There could be some crazy mixing of custom signal handlers mixed with the interpreter's standard KeyboardInterrupt/CTRL+C handler that's resulting in this sort of behavior.  For example, the read() call sees the signal and bails, but it re-raises the signal after deregistering it's handler.  I wouldn't know for sure without inspecting the interpreter codebase. This is why I generally shy away from making use of async exceptions.... EDIT 2 I think there's a good case for a bug report. Again more theories...(just based on reading code)  See the file object source: http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/release26-maint/Objects/fileobject.c?revision=81277&view=markup file_read calls Py_UniversalNewlineFread().  fread can return with an error with errno = EINTR (it performs its own signal handling).  In this case Py_UniversalNewlineFread() bails but does not perform any signal checking with PyErr_CheckSignals() so that the handlers can get called synchronously.  file_read clears the file error but also does not call PyErr_CheckSignals(). See getline() and getline_via_fgets() for examples of how it's used.  The pattern is documented in this bug report for a similar issue: ( http://bugs.python.org/issue1195 ).  So it seems that the signal is handled at an indeterminate time by the interpreter. I guess there's little value in diving any deeper since it's still not clear whether the sys.stdin.read() example is a proper analog of your ""dostuff()"" function.  (there could be multiple bugs at play)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/4606942', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/235207/']}",jdg_368194

Question:
I am writing a baby program for practice. What I am trying to accomplish is basically a simple little GUI which displays services (for Linux); with buttons to start, stop, enable, and disable services (Much like the msconfig application ""Services"" tab in Windows). I am using C++ with Qt Creator on Fedora 21. I want to create the GUI with C++, and populating the GUI with the list of services by calling bash scripts, and calling bash scripts on button clicks to do the appropriate action (enable, disable, etc.) But when the C++ GUI calls the bash script (using system(""path/to/script.sh"") ) the return value is only for exit success. How do I receive the output of the script itself , so that I can in turn use it to display on the GUI? For conceptual example: if I were trying to display the output of ( systemctl --type service | cut -d "" "" -f 1 ) into a GUI I have created in C++, how would I go about doing that? Is this even the correct way to do what I am trying to accomplish? If not, What is the right way? and Is there still a way to do it using my current method? I have looked for a solution to this problem but I can't find information on how to return values from Bash to C++, only how to call Bash scripts from C++.

I've written some code which has verified that no solutions exist for $p,q < 30,000$ but don't know how to go about a formal proof. Background: To practice group theory, I decided to try and classify small groups on my own. I got stuck trying to classify groups of order $p^2q$ for distinct primes $p,q$ . Suppose $G$ has order $p^2q$ for distinct primes $p,q$ . By Sylow theorems, there exists a Sylow $p$ subgroup of order $p^2$ , and a Sylow $q$ subgroup of order $q$ . We can express $G$ as a semidirect product if at least one of them is normal. A test for normality is if the Sylow subgroups are unique. We have the following: $|\text{Syl}_p(G)| \in \{1,q\}$ $|\text{Syl}_p(G)| \equiv 1\mod p$ $|\text{Syl}_q(G)| \in \{1,p,p^2\}$ $|\text{Syl}_q(G)| \equiv 1\mod q$ Unlike the case of groups of order $pq$ , it is not immediately clear from these facts that one of the Sylow subgroups is unique. Namely, the following situation might occur: $p < q < p^2$ , such that: $|\text{Syl}_p(G)| = q$ , $s$ is a positive integer with $q = 1 + ps$ , $|\text{Syl}_q(G)| = p^2$ , $t$ is a positive integer with $p^2 = 1 + qt$ . In fact, a concrete example of this is the following: $p = 2, q = 3, t = s = 1$ . However, when I tried to find other primes $p,q$ satisfying the equations ""There exists $s,t > 0$ such that $p^2 = 1 + qt, q = 1 + ps$ "", I couldn't find any. Are there any solutions to these equations other than the one I found? I'm a geometer so I have no idea I how do anything with diophantine equations, so all I could do was write code to search for solutions. My code has verified that there are no solutions where $p$ and $q$ are odd primes less than 30,000. Does someone have a nice proof that no non-trivial solutions exist?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","If $p^2=1\mod q$ then $p=\pm 1\mod q$ . Suppose that $p=1\mod q$ . Then, $p=1+qt$ for some $t\in\mathbb{Z}$ . Of course, it's clear, in fact, that $t\geqslant 0$ . Similarly, since $q=1\mod p$ we can write $q=1+ps$ for some integer $s\geqslant 0$ . So, then $$p=1+qt=1+(1+ps)t=1+t+ps$$ Since $t,s\geqslant 0$ this is impossible. If $p=-1\mod q$ then we can write $p=qt-1$ for some $t\geqslant 0$ . Again, we can write $q=1+ps$ for some $s\geqslant 0$ . Then, $$p=qt-1=(1+ps)t-1=1+t+ps-1$$ The only possible solution to this is $s=t=1$ . This says that $p=q-1$ and $q=1+p$ which of course is impossible since $p$ and $q$ are odd.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3194311', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/357206/']}",jdg_363678

Question:
I just wanted to understand the meaning of the following statement and whether they seem correct. test -x /usr/bin/find || exit 0 Command 1Command 2Command 3 The output of test -x /usr/bin/find is always 0. That means the exit 0 command will be executed , meaning Command 1, 2, 3 will never be executed. Am I right here?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","test -x /usr/bin/find (or [ -x /usr/bin/find ] ) does not output anything.  The test will be true if /usr/bin/find is an existing executable file, and false if the pathname does not exist, or if it's not executable. If test exits successfully (with a zero exits status, signifying ""no error""), the shell will execute the rest of the commands.  If it exits with a failure (a non-zero exit status, signifying ""some error""), exit 0 will terminate the current shell, preventing the rest of the commands from running. It would arguably be better to use exit 1 or just exit in place of exit 0 when find can't be found in /usr/bin though.  Using exit 0 masks the exit status of test (which would be non-zero), and prevents the caller of this script from being notified of the failure of finding find at the given location. Related to the fact that an exit status of zero evaluates to  ""true"" when tested as a boolean in the shell: Why the Unix command exit with non-zero value in Shell and evaluates to True when used in bash if condition? Related to using || and && in general: What are the shell's control and redirection operators?",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/685754', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/508675/']}",jdg_81125

Question:
I've come across some apparently-conflicting patterns of behaviour.  I'd like to understand why they each exist.  I'll call them ""conventions"" for the sake of simplicity, though I'm not sure the term is a great fit for all of them. Convention 1 : we do not commit generated artefacts (especially binaries) to source control.  I've been aware of this creed for almost as long as I've known about source control.  Reasons for this convention include: (1) it's better (more reliable, safer from viruses) to use a build server than to deploy locally-built binaries into production, (2) there could be differences between the source code and the binary, (3) what whatisname says in the comments. Convention 2 : in my organisation (not sure if it's common practice), we commit the .js and .map.js files generated from .ts files to source control.  I'm a late arrival at the TypeScript party, and this makes me feel like I brought the wrong drinks. My Googling has lead to plenty of discussion about ""what"", but nothing compelling about ""why"". What is the fundamental thinking behind each? Side note : There is also: Convention 3 : we commit code (not binaries) generated by Entity Framework from a database schema to source control.  I think this gets its definitive exemption from Convention 1 because it means you don't have to have the source schema available everywhere you need to build the binaries (e.g. the build server).  There are some convenience benefits too, but I think you could argue for convention 1 with most of those if you felt like it.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","What you listed under #2 and #3 are examples for generated source code files, so what you are actually asking here is: why/when put generated files into source control ,  (and why/when not)? To answer this in general, you have to take a closer look at the files and their process of creation: Reasons why to check them in: Starting the generation process isn't (yet) part of a full build, it is a manual step. Hence, after a checkout, without the generated parts, one would not be able to run a build immediately. This would effectively make it impossible to run an automated build on a build server. Devs want to have a diff-able history of the generated files, which might help to trace errors. The generated files contain manually added parts (hopefully in a way the generator does not overwrite them when run again), and those would get lost when they were not kept in source control The generation process takes a lot of time, and the repo serves as a kind of cache. Reasons against it: The build process is expected to generate the missing files automatically, so it should not be necessary to keep them in source control - hence not checking them in serves as a test of the build process itself (when it fails or succeeds after a clean checkout). The top reason is exactly what @whatisname wrote: there is certain risk for forgetting to put required files into source control (especially the generation sources). The automated build, including the generation, serves as a quality gate to make sure noone forgets to add new files, which will fail if the generation is not successful, or code which relies on those generated files. There could be undetected inconsistencies between the currently checked-in files and the files one gets when running the generation again. Those files make the repo larger than necessary The generated files contain a generation time stamp or other ephemeral local information, so everytime a new build would run, one had to check the generated files in again, even if their source did not change. I recommend you check the examples about .js, .map.js files and generated code from EF against the former list, then you will probably find which reasons apply to your case. You can also apply the above list of reasons to generated binaries as well. I guess when you do it, it becomes clearly apparent why they are usually not put under source control.

","The ""best"" way to achieve that sort of thing is almost probably opinion based. The way I prefer uses the backlog of the native terminal. Knowing that the backlog of tty[N] can be accessed via /dev/vcs[N], I simply fire cat /dev/vcs[N] from my Xterm and do whatever I want with the result displayed. Of course if your Xterm user is different from the owner of the tty you want to dump, you might need to use sudo.

","In his post Model binding JSON POSTs in ASP.NET Core from 2016, Andrew Lock explains that in order to bind a JSON POST in ASP.NET Core, the [FromBody] attribute must be specified on the argument, like so: [HttpPost]public IActionResult CreateAccount([FromBody] Account account){    // ...} With the ASP.NET Core 2.1 introduction of [ApiController] , this is no longer required. Of importance here is that this attribute effectively infers the presence of the [FromBody] attribute when the type being bound is ""complex"" (which it is in your example). In other words, it's as though you have written the code as I demonstrated above. In his post, Andrew also states the following: In some cases you may need to be able to bind both types of data to an action. In that case, you're a little bit stuck, as it won't be possible to have the same end point receive two different sets of data. Here, when referring to both types of data , Andrew is referring to both a JSON post and a form-based POST. He continues on to explain how to actually achieve the required result. Modifying his example for your purposes, you'd need to do something like the following: // Form.[HttpPost(""FromForm"")]public IActionResult CreateAccountFromForm([FromForm] Account account)) =>    DoSomething(account);// JSON.[HttpPost(""FromBody"")]public IActionResult CreateAccountFromBody(Account account) =>    DoSomething(account);private IActionResult DoSomething(Account account) {    // ...} In Andrew's example, the [FromBody] is explicit and the [FromForm] is implicit, but given the affect that [ApiController] has on the defaults, the modified example above flips that around. See my answer here for a potential approach that allows for the same URL to be used for both FromForm and FromBody using a custom IActionConstraint .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/51430923', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4847201/']}",jdg_318069

Question:
Short background I'm aware that a hot air balloon rises up because of the less density than air. But I'm not sure about how that lower density is reached, and how it can be sustained over time. At constant P and mass, we can write: $$\frac{T}{V}=k$$ Then as T increases, if mass is constant, density decreases. Question But doesn't the mass change also?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","After the initial heating of the air in the balloon, while the balloon is still on the ground, it stretches a little and takes its shape. Further heating does change its volume much, which causes the increase in pressure, but, since the balloon is open at the bottom, high pressure inside pushes the air out, which roughly equalizes the pressure inside to the pressure outside and keeps it more or less constant. So a more accurate formula for the hot air balloon should be $Tn=k$, where $k=PV/R$, i.e., as the temperature rises, the mass and therefore the density of the air inside the balloon decreases, which creates buoyancy.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/405173', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/-1/']}",jdg_236394

Question:
I know that onReceive() of the Broadcast receiver and handleMessage() of Handler run on the same UI thread. Suppose I want to communicate between two services, within the same app (process) . I can extend a broadcast receiver class and register an event OR a Handler and then pass its instance to the other service to be used for sendMessage() calls.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I can extend a broadcast receiver class and register an event If you mean that you are doing this via LocalBroadcastManager (see Mr. Kapeller's excellent answer for details ), Handler will be slightly more efficient, as LocalBroadcastManager uses a Handler . However, the performance difference should not be enough to matter. The same goes for other in-process event bus implementations, such as greenrobot's EventBus and Square's Otto. All should be fast enough that other concerns, such as maintainability, should be paramount. If you mean that you are doing this via system broadcasts (e.g., sendBroadcast() called on a Context ), then Handler , LocalBroadcastManager , or other event bus implementations will be significantly faster, and more secure as well. All of this assumes that the two services are in the same process. The fastest solution of all is to combine the two services into one. This is particularly true if they have the same lifespan.

","I tend to use analogies. Take whatever the topic is, and think of something completely non-technical that they would understand, and explain it to them that way.

Each card has a set of properties (value [A-K], suit, face up/down), which may or may not be unique. A card can be used in many different ways, without altering anything about the card (held in a hand, put in a deck, played on the field, etc.) If you want to get into interfaces: A card must conform to certain standards, such as size and shape. If you do something to one card, that doesn't affect any other card. A deck is a ""container"" object, which holds <= 52 card instances. The deck can have various operations done on it, such as shuffle, show the top card, draw 5, etc. The deck doesn't need to know or care about a card's value/suit, only that it is a card.

Question:
I am currently working with a client in the healthcare sector. Part of the work will involve contact with sensitive patient health information (PHI). The client uses AWS and keeps their sensitive data inside of a Virtual Private Cloud. It is required that I connect to a VPN Server to get access to their AWS services. They use OpenVPN client. But they have the VPN configured so that when I'm connected to it, all of my internet traffic gets tunneled through the VPN server, not just the traffic bound for their network resources. This slows my internet connection down to about 1.5 Mbps down, which is not ideal. I brought it up with them and they said ""the security rules prevent anyone from any IP address except the VPN endpoint from getting any information about our instances."".

You're connection may be secured, or not. The customer has no way to control the security of your internet connection, so they make sure you don't have access to the internet, apart from the connection they do control, while you are connected to their network. 2 - as explained by Ron Maupin in a comment, a user inside the remote network can bypass internal security to gain Internet access through your VPN connection.

","I have quickly put together a simple solution based on a CoordinatorLayout.Behavior . It's not perfect, you can maybe spend some time fine tuning it a bit, but it's not bad. Anyway the result should look something like this: As a small side note before I start with the answer: I strongly recommend that you use the NestedScrollView from the support library instead of a normal ScrollView . They are identical in any way, but the NestedScrollView implements correct nested scrolling behaviour on lower API levels. Anyway let's start with my answer: The solution I came up with would work with any scrollable container, be it a ScrollView , ListView or RecyclerView and you don't need to subclass any Views to implement it. First you need to add Google's Design Support Library to your project if you aren't already using it: compile 'com.android.support:design:25.0.1' Remember that if you aren't targeting API level 25 (which you should by the way) then you need to include the newest version for your API level (eg. compile 'com.android.support:design:24.2.0' for API level 24). Whatever scrollable container you are using needs to wrapped in a CoordinatorLayout in your layout. In my example I am using a NestedScrollView : <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?><android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""    android:layout_width=""match_parent""    android:layout_height=""match_parent"">    <android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView        android:layout_width=""match_parent""        android:layout_height=""match_parent"">        <!-- content -->    </android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView></android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout> The CoordinatorLayout allows you to assign a Behavior to its direct child views. In this case we are going to assign a Behavior to the NestedScrollView which is going implement the overscroll bounce effect. Let's just take a look at the code of the Behavior : public class OverScrollBounceBehavior extends CoordinatorLayout.Behavior<View> {    private int mOverScrollY;    public OverScrollBounceBehavior() {    }    public OverScrollBounceBehavior(Context context, AttributeSet attrs) {        super(context, attrs);    }    @Override    public boolean onStartNestedScroll(CoordinatorLayout coordinatorLayout, View child, View directTargetChild, View target, int nestedScrollAxes) {        mOverScrollY = 0;        return true;    }    @Override    public void onNestedScroll(CoordinatorLayout coordinatorLayout, View child, View target, int dxConsumed, int dyConsumed, int dxUnconsumed, int dyUnconsumed) {        if (dyUnconsumed == 0) {            return;        }        mOverScrollY -= dyUnconsumed;        final ViewGroup group = (ViewGroup) target;        final int count = group.getChildCount();        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {            final View view = group.getChildAt(i);            view.setTranslationY(mOverScrollY);        }    }    @Override    public void onStopNestedScroll(CoordinatorLayout coordinatorLayout, View child, View target) {        final ViewGroup group = (ViewGroup) target;        final int count = group.getChildCount();        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {            final View view = group.getChildAt(i);            ViewCompat.animate(view).translationY(0).start();        }    }} Explaining what a Behavior is and how they work is beyond the scope of this answer so I am just going to quickly explain what the above code does. The Behavior intercepts all scroll events that happen in the direct children of the CoordinatorLayout . In the onStartNestedScroll() method we return true since we are interested in any scroll events. In onNestedScroll() we look at the dyUnconsumed parameter which tells us how much of the vertical scroll was not consumed by the scrolling container (in other words overscroll) and then translate the children of the scrolling container by that amount. Since we are just getting delta values we need to sum up all of them in the mOverscrollY variable. onStopNestedScroll() is called when the scrolling event stops. This is when we animate all children of the scrolling container back to their original position. To assign the Behavior to the NestedScrollView we need to use the layout_behavior xml attribute and pass in the full class name of the Behavior we want to use. In my example the above class is in the package com.github.wrdlbrnft.testapp so I have to set com.github.wrdlbrnft.testapp.OverScrollBounceBehavior as value. layout_behavior is a custom attribute of the CoordinatorLayout so we need to prefix it with the correct namespace: <?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?><android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout    xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""    xmlns:app=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto""    android:layout_width=""match_parent""    android:layout_height=""match_parent"">    <android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView        android:layout_width=""match_parent""        android:layout_height=""match_parent""        app:layout_behavior=""com.github.wrdlbrnft.testapp.OverScrollBounceBehavior"">        <!-- content -->    </android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView></android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout> Notice the namespace I added on the CoordinatorLayout and the app:layout_behavior attribute I added on the NestedScrollView . And that is all you have to do! While this answer turned out to be longer than I intended I skipped over some of the basics concering the CoordinatorLayout and Behaviors . So if you are unfamiliar with these or have any other further questions feel free to ask.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/40758681', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/7144690/']}",jdg_137580

Question:
I'm trying to drive a STP16FN06 from a Raspberry Pi GPIO pin but I'm a bit lost. The schema below represent (I think) how it is currently wired, on the left the RPi pin + ground and on the right a 5V DC supply. simulate this circuit – Schematic created using CircuitLab If I remove the MOSFET and plug it directly to the 5V, it light up so this part is ok. When I set the pin to high, I have 3.3 between it and the ground but nothing shows and from what I understand the MOSFET should be on between 2 and 4V. I'm not really sure what I've missed but being a bit new to electronics there's probably some beginner mistakes in there.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You have to actually read the datasheet.  Note that the gate threshold voltage can be up to 4 V, and that is only where it starts to conduct.  This MOSFET is simply inappropriate for this application.  It is also much larger and for much higher voltage and power than you need.  Those by themselves don't hurt you except that other specs have been traded off to get those.  MOSFETs that can handle more than 30 V usually can't be turned on very well by logic level signals, and this one is no exception. Replace with a more suitable FET, like the IRLML2502, and your circuit should work as shown.  Or, you can use a jellybean NPN transistor, like 2N4401, with a base resistor and maybe adjust R2 a bit. The diagram in the MOSFETs datasheet that could (should?) have alerted you is on p.6: This diagram shows that your MOSFET can handle no current with its gate at 3V, and it can handle the current it is rated for (16A) from ~ 5.5V. (Note that such diagrams are typical, not worst case, so you can't use them for accurate design calculations, but they still give good indication). You should use a MOSFET has the vertical part of the curve below 3V. Such a MOSFET will be rated for much lower currents. If you realy must use a MOSFET like this one you will need to amplify (convert) your Pi's output to a higher voltage, for instance using a MOSFET driver chip.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/81135', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/28425/']}",jdg_177837

","Autoload local package using composer (without going to packagist every time you change). There are many ways to do so, I will be covering 2 of them: In all cases we have 2 main parties: - the local package (the code that we do not want to publish on packagist to be able to autoload it in our project composer). - the main project (the code base that needs to use the local package code, can be another package and or any project). Method 1: (direct namespace) Open the main project composer.json file and autoload the local package namespaces using any method (PSR-4, PSR-0, ...). example: if in the composer.json of the local package we have: ""autoload"": {    ""psr-4"": {      “Local\\Pack\\"": ""library""    }  },  ""autoload-dev"": {    ""psr-4"": {      ""Local\\Pack\\Tests\\"": ""tests""    }  }, then in the composer.json of the main project we should have: ""autoload"": {    ""psr-4"": {      ""Mahmoudz\\Project\\"": ""src"",      ""Local\\Pack\\"": ""../path/to/local/pack/library”                   << referencing the other local package    }  },  ""autoload-dev"": {    ""psr-4"": {      ""Mahmoudz\\Project\\Tests\\"": ""tests""    }  }, Advantages: - you don’t touche the vendor directory (running composer update by mistake will not override your local changes) - you don’t need your package to be on packagist to use it - you work in one place (the local package) and the changes are automatically loaded in the main project Disadvantages: - you cannot publish the composer.json on production (needs editing before publishing to require the real package) Method 2: (local repository) Download the local package from a local repository. local package: 1. initialize git in the package (even if you don’t want to use it - no need to commit anything) 2. add composer.json file. In the file make sure you have the following: ""name"": ""vendor-name/package-name"",  ""autoload"": { …   // use whichever method you prefer, but make sure it’s being loaded correctly""minimum-stability"": ""dev"" composer dump-autoload main project: 1. edit your composer.json to contain the following: ""repositories"": [    {      ""type"": ""vcs"",      ""url"": ""/full/path/to/the/local/package/package-name""    }  ],  ""require"": {    ""vendor-name/package-name"": ""dev-master""  }, composer update vendor-name/package-name now check your vendor directory you should see the vendor-name/package- name NOTE: whenever you make change in the local package (not the vendor) you need to git commit then you can composer update the main project, it will get the latest copy of the repo to the main project vendor directory. Advantage: - you don’t touch the vendor directory (running composer update by mistake will not override your local changes) - you don’t need your package to be on packagist to use it Disadvantage: - you have to keep committing your changes (in the local package) and then running composer update in the main project - you cannot publish the composer.json on production (needs editing before publishing to require the real package)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/17426192', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2107182/']}",jdg_259512

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You'll have to think about the Ruby parser. This will work fine: age >= 21 ? puts(""You're over 21!"") : puts(""You're too young."") The reason is that if you use the puts method without brackets, the parser doesn't understand the : token that comes afterwards; it doesn't realise that it is associated with the ternary operator earlier. You can also do this: puts age >= 21 ? ""You're over 21!"" : ""You're too young."" This is fine -- the parser doesn't run into any ambiguities here. You can also do this: puts ""You're #{ age >= 21 ? 'over 21!' : 'too young.' }"" Here's why the ambiguity happens. Let's say you have two functions, x and a , like this: 2.0.0-p195 :033 > def x(y)2.0.0-p195 :034?>   y + 12.0.0-p195 :035?>   end => nil 2.0.0-p195 :036 > def a(b)2.0.0-p195 :037?>   b + 22.0.0-p195 :038?>   end => nil The brackets don't make a difference here: 2.0.0-p195 :039 > x a 1 => 4 2.0.0-p195 :040 > x a(1) => 4 2.0.0-p195 :041 > x(a(1)) => 4 2.0.0-p195 :042 > x(a 1) => 4 But if x could take more than one parameter? Now you have to help the parser out: 2.0.0-p195 :043 > def x(y, z)2.0.0-p195 :044?>   y + z + 12.0.0-p195 :045?>   end Let's make a call without brackets like before: 2.0.0-p195 :047 > x a 1, 2 Are you passing a(1), 2 to x , or are you trying to call a(1, 2) and pass the result to x ? By convention Ruby assumes you are trying to call a(1, 2) , but a only takes one argument, so you get an error: ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (2 for 1)  from (irb):36:in `a' So you need brackets: 2.0.0-p195 :052 > x a(1), 2 => 6",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/19670743', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2864703/']}",jdg_238773

","get_deleter Any reference is removed from the return type, then a reference is added back. In conformant C++11, adding a & to an existing & (or && ) produces a & . In C++03 however, that would be forming a reference to reference type, which was illegal. Likely MSVC is using the old rules, or that code was written when it did and remains because it is harmless. constructor Here they remove the reference, add const , and then add the reference back, to be passing by const reference. This is because adding const directly to a reference type does nothing ! (§8.3.2/1) In either C++11 or C++03, the parameter declaration would be valid but would not add a const , if the reference weren't removed and replaced. operator* This is essentially the same as get_deleter , but they went about it a different way, and _Ty cannot be a reference type to begin with.

Question:
I am migrating an applciation from windows to linux. I am facing problem with respect to WaitForSingleObject and WaitForMultipleObjects interfaces. In my application I spawn multiple threads where all threads wait for events from parent process or periodically run for every t seconds. I have checked pthread_cond_timedwait , but we have to specify absolute time for this. How can I implement this in Unix?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Stick to pthread_cond_timedwait and use clock_gettime . For example: struct timespec ts;clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &ts);ts.tv_sec += 10; // ten secondswhile (!some_condition && ret == 0)    ret = pthread_cond_timedwait(&cond, &mutex, &ts); Wrap it in a function if you wish. UPDATE: complementing the answer based on our comments. POSIX doesn't have a single API to wait for ""all types"" of events/objects as Windows does. Each one has its own functions. The simplest way to notify a thread for termination is using atomic variables/operations. For example: Main thread: // Declare it globally (argh!) or pass by argument when the thread is createdatomic_t must_terminate = ATOMIC_INIT(0);// ""Signal"" termination by changing the initial valueatomic_inc(&must_terminate); Secondary thread: // While it holds the default valuewhile (atomic_read(&must_terminate) == 0) {    // Keep it running...}// Do proper cleanup, if needed// Call pthread_exit() providing the exit status Another alternative is to send a cancellation request using pthread_cancel . The thread being cancelled must have called pthread_cleanup_push to register any necessary cleanup handler. These handlers are invoked in the reverse order they were registered. Never call pthread_exit from a cleanup handler, because it's undefined behaviour. The exit status of a cancelled thread is PTHREAD_CANCELED . If you opt for this alternative, I recommend you to read mainly about cancellation points and types. And last but not least, calling pthread_join will make the current thread block until the thread passed by argument terminates. As bonus, you'll get the thread's exit status.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2719580', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/7965/']}",jdg_76067

Question:
Test-driven development (TDD) is big these days. I often see it recommended as a solution for a wide range of problems here in Programmers SE and other venues. I wonder why it works. From an engineering point of view, it puzzles me for two reasons: The ""write test + refactor till pass"" approach looks incredibly anti-engineering. If civil engineers used that approach for bridge construction, or car designers for their cars, for example, they would be reshaping their bridges or cars at very high cost, and the result would be a patched-up mess with no well thought-out architecture. The ""refactor till pass"" guideline is often taken as a mandate to forget architectural design and do whatever is necessary to comply with the test; in other words, the test, rather than the user, sets the requirement. In this situation, how can we guarantee good ""ilities"" in the outcomes, i.e. a final result that is not only correct but also extensible, robust, easy to use, reliable, safe, secure, etc.? This is what architecture usually does. Testing cannot guarantee that a system works; it can only show that it doesn't. In other words, testing may show you that a system contains defects if it fails a test, but a system that passes all tests is not safer than a system that fails them. Test coverage, test quality and other factors are crucial here. The false safe feelings that an ""all green"" outcomes produces to many people has been reported in civil and aerospace industries as extremely dangerous, because it may be interepreted as ""the system is fine"", when it really means ""the system is as good as our testing strategy"". Often, the testing strategy is not checked. Or, who tests the tests? In summary, I am more concerned about the ""driven"" bit in TDD than about the ""test"" bit. Testing is perfectly OK; what I don't get is driving the design by doing it. I would like to see answers containing reasons why TDD in software engineering is a good practice, and why the issues that I have explained above are not relevant (or not relevant enough) in the case of software. Thank you.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I think there is one misconception here. In software design, the design is very close to the product. In civil engineering, architecture, the design is decoupled from the actual product: there are blueprints that hold the design, that are then materialized into the finished product, and those are seperated by huge amounts of time and effort. TDD is testing the design. But every car design and building design is also tested. Construction techniques are first calculated, then tested in smaller scale, then tested in larger scale, before put out in a real building. When they invented H-beams and the load for example, rest asured that this has been tried and tried again before it they actually build the first bridge with it. Designs of cars are also tested, by designing prototypes, and yes, certainly by adjusting things that are not exactly right, until it lives up to the expectations.Part of this process though is slower, because as you said, you can't mess around much with the product. But every redesign of a car draws on experiences learned from former ones, and every building has about a thousend years of fundamentals behind it about the importance of space, light, insulation, strength, etc. Details are changed and improved, both in the buildings and in redesigns for newer ones. Also, parts are tested. Perhaps not exactly in the same style as software, but mechanical parts (wheels, igniters, cables) are usually measured and put under stress to know the sizes are correct, no abnormalities are to be seen, etc. They might be xrayed or laser-measured, they tap bricks to spot broken ones, they might be actually tested in some configuration or other, or they draw a limited representation of a large group to really put it to the test. Those are all things you can put in place with TDD. And indeed, testing is no guarantee. Programs crash, cars break down, and buildings start doing funny things when the wind blows. But... 'safety' is not a boolean question. Even when you can't ever include everything, being able to cover - say - 99% of the eventualities is better than covering only 50%. Not testing and then finding out the steel hasn't settled well and is brittle and breaks at the first smack of a hammer when you just put up your main structure is a plain waste of money. That there are other concerns that might still hurt the building do not make it any less stupid to allow an easily preventable flaw bring down your design. As to the practice of TDD, that is a matter of balancing. The cost of doing it one way (for example, not testing, and then picking up the pieces later), versus the cost of doing it another way. It is always a balance. But do not think that other design processes do not have testing and TDD in place.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/41409', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/5021/']}",jdg_274395

I'm guessing that particular attempt was just a bad transfer or something.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Since nobody from the comments posted the answer, I guess I get the pleasure ;) No such file or directory comes from when the kernel tries to invoke the dynamic linker specified by the ELF executable's .interp field, but no such file exists. The .interp field can be found with the following command: objdump -j .interp -s ./hello_world In the case of this example, the executable's .interp field was /lib/ld-linux.so.3 , but the name of the dynamic linker on the BeagleBone Black is /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 . This happened because the program was compiled with a slightly different toolchain to the one required for the platform. It should be arm-linux-gnueabihf-* rather than arm-linux-gnueabi-* . The difference between the two is that the Cortex-A8 uses specific floating point registers with the hard-float version ( armhf ) of the EABI, but the original EABI ( armel ) uses integer registers for passing around floating point numbers. As a result, armel programs will run on armhf (provided the dynamic linker is set to the correct path!), but not vice versa. Simply adding a symbolic link ln -s /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 /lib/ld-linux.so.3 is enough to resolve this issue, but the correct fix is to use the right toolchain when compiling the program in the first place.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/31929092', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1000626/']}",jdg_294489

I just started my abstract algebra class and I am struggling with the concept of equivalence relations.

Question:
Possible Duplicate: Is there a regular expression to detect a valid regular expression? Regular expression for finding a regular expression? I have an application that enables the user to input a regular expression. How do I check against any input of regular expressions and make sure they are valid ones, because if they are not there there will be preg_match errors? I don't want to use the '@' before preg_match, so if there's a way to check the validity of the user input of regular expressions that'd be great. The regular expression system of PHP seems to be rather too complicated for me to come up with a regular expression for them.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Mathematically, it is impossible to validate a regular expression using a regular expression. This is so because (formal) regular expressions can only recognize regular languages . A language is any set of strings. For example, the set of all decimal numbers is a language (which by the way can be described using a regular expression); the set of all valid regular expressions is also a language. Regular languages are languages that require only fixed finite memory (not a function of the input size) to be recognized. The language that contains all valid regular expressions is not a regular language; hence it is impossible to recognize a regular expression using a regular expression. To understand this, notice that regular expressions contain parentheses in them that must match. Hence, if an ""("" has occurred, a "")"" must occur later on. This is impossible to describe with a machine that has only fixed finite memory. For, if there were a way to do it, and your regular expression had a finite memory of K different states (for some integer K), an expression with K opening parentheses followed by K closing parentheses, though a valid regular expression would have been unable to be recognized by that machine -- a contradiction (notice that in formal languages, our assumption is that text processing occurs one character at a time, from left to right, which is the same for applied regular expressions). We call languages such as the one that describes regular expressions context-free and not regular . (It is trivial to prove that regular expressions do not form a regular language using the Pumping Lemma ) So, there is a fundamental computer science problem in recognizing regular expressions using regular expressions: It is mathematically impossible to do so. Regular languages are possible to be recognized by finite-state automata , i.e. machines with finite states but without memory. To overcome your problem, you need to add some memory which is dependant on the input size. Regular expressions, as they are context-free (fortunately they're not some obscure, hard-to-recognize type of language) can be recognized in linear time using a push-down automaton. This is a ""for"" loop that goes through the expression one token (usually a character) at a time and keeps track of what it's seen on a stack , i.e. it ""pushes"" data that it laters ""pops"" in a first-in-last-out fashion. (Example of data pushed to the stack: ""I need to remember to find a matching `)' later on!""; you can ""push"" this as many times as you need; you can ""pop"" it later, when you need to check if you actually needed to have matched an opening parenthesis previously). Of course, writing your own recognition engine for regular expressions would be a bit of an overhead -- but if you want to do it, you should know the above limitations. It would be more wise to employ an already existing mechanism to do it -- I suspect you could give that job to a regular expression library or a language that is more keen on handling regular expressions such as Perl; but the @-method doesn't sound like too bad of an idea after all: It may be slow, but your users may input terribly slow regular expressions anyway; and it may be a bad practice, but in your case it seems the best possible solution available.

","We can facilitate the complex plane analysis by making use of the identity $$\sin^2x=\frac{1-\cos 2x}{2}$$ Then, we have $$\begin{align}I(a)&=\int_0^{\pi}\frac{1}{a+\sin ^2x}dx\\\\&=\int_0^{\pi}\frac{2}{(2a+1)-a\cos 2x}dx\\\\&=\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{1}{(2a+1)-\cos x}dx \tag 1\end{align}$$ Now, we move to the complex plane and let $z=e^{ix}$ in $(1)$.  Thus, $dx=\frac{dz}{iz}$ and we have $$I(a)=i\oint_{|z|=1}\frac{2}{z^2-2(2a+1)z+1}dz$$ The pole inside the unit circle is at $z=(2a+1)-\sqrt{(2a+1)^2-1}$.

Question:
Let $\mathrm{ODD}(n)$ be the set of permutations in $\mathfrak{S}_n$ whose cycle lengths are all odd. It is known that$$ \#\mathrm{ODD}(n) = \begin{cases} ((n-1)!!)^2 &\textrm{ if $n$ is even}; \\ n\cdot((n-2)!!)^2 &\textrm{ if $n$ is odd}. \end{cases}$$ Set $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{ODD}}(n,t) = \sum_{\pi \in \mathrm{ODD}(n)} t^{\kappa(\pi)}$, where $\kappa(\pi)$ is the number of cycles of $\pi \in \mathfrak{S}_n$. Then it is easy to show that$$ \sum_{n\geq0}\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{ODD}}(n,t) \cdot \frac{z^n}{n!} =  \left(\frac{\sqrt{1-z^2}}{1-z}\right)^t$$From this one can show that$$ \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{ODD}}(n,t)= \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}\frac{1}{2^i\cdot i!}\prod_{j=0}^{n-1-2i}(t+j)\prod_{k=0}^{i-1}(t-2k)(n-2k)(n-2k-1)$$In particular if we set $t:=2k$ to be an even integer, then$$ \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{ODD}}(n,2k)=\frac{(n-1)!}{(2k-1)!} \cdot \sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^j\binom{k}{j}\prod_{i=0}^{k-j-1}(n+2i)(n+2i+1)\prod_{i=0}^{j-1}(n-2i)(n-2i-1)$$Thus, for example $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{ODD}}(n,2)=2\cdot n!$ and $\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{ODD}}(n,4)=4n\cdot n!$. Define the polynomial $P_k(x)$ by setting$$ \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{ODD}}(n,2k) = \frac{(n-1)!\cdot k! \cdot 2^k}{(2k-1)!}\cdot P_k(n)$$ For example, $P_1(x)=x$; $P_2(x)=3x^2$; $P_3(x)=10x^3+5x$; $P_4(x)=35x^4+70x^2$; $P_5(x)=7\cdot 3^2(2x^5+10x^3+3x)$; $P_6(x)=3\cdot 7\cdot 11(2x^6+20x^4+23x^2)$; et cetera Conjecture 1 : $P_k(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $k$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, with zero constant term, and which is odd if $k$ is odd and even if $k$ is even. Conjecture 2 : We have,$$ \sum_{k \geq 0} \frac{P_k(x)}{(2k-1)!!} \cdot z^k = \frac{1}{2}\cdot\left( \frac{1+z}{1-z}\right)^x$$(The constant term on the RHS is $1/2$ so take whatever convention for $P_0(x)$ or $(-1)!!$ for that to work.) With regard to Conjecture 2, note that from the above we have$$ \sum_{n\geq0}\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{ODD}}(n,2k) \cdot \frac{z^n}{n!} =  \left(\frac{1+z}{1-z}\right)^k$$ Question : Are these conjectures correct? Are these cycle generating functions studied somewhere?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I'll start by addressing conjecture 2. By summing your generating fun over all values of $k$ we obtain$$F(z,w)=\sum_{n\geq 0}\sum_{k\geq 0}C_{\text{ODD}}(n,2k)\frac{z^n}{n!}w^k=\sum_{k\geq 0}w^k\left(\frac{1+z}{1-z}\right)^k=\frac{1-z}{1-w-z-wz}$$From here we see that$$\sum_{n\geq 1}\sum_{k\geq 1}\frac{P_k(n)}{(2k-1)!!}w^k \frac{z^{n-1}}{(n-1)!}=\frac{1}{2}\frac{d}{dz}\int\left(F(z,w)-1\right)dw$$$$=\int \frac{w}{(1-w)^2}\frac{1}{\left(1-z(\frac{1+w}{1-w})\right)^2}dw$$By extracting the coefficients of $z^{n-1}/(n-1)!$ on both sides we have$$\sum_{k\geq 0}\frac{P_k(n)}{(2k-1)!!}w^k=\int \frac{nw}{(1-w)^2}\left(\frac{1+w}{1-w}\right)^{n-1} dw=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1+w}{1-w}\right)^n+\text{constant}$$which is what we wanted. I just realized that we can also answer conjecture 1 by making use of this identity. Start with the expansion$$\left(\frac{1+w}{1-w}\right)^n=\left(1+\frac{2w}{1-w}\right)^n=1+\sum_{r\geq 1} \binom{n}{r}\left(\frac{2w}{1-w}\right)^r$$$$=1+\sum_{k\geq 1}w^k\sum_{r\geq 1}2^r\binom{n}{r}\binom{k-1}{r-1}$$which gives us an explicit formula for $P_k$$$P_k(n)=\sum_{r\geq 1}2^{r-1}(2k-1)!!\binom{n}{r}\binom{k-1}{r-1}$$Which immediately tells us that $P_k(n)$, as a linear combination of $\binom{n}{r}$ for $1\le r\le k$, is a polynomial of degree $k$ with no constant term. Combined with the fact that $\left(\frac{1+w}{1-w}\right)^n=\left(\frac{1-w}{1+w}\right)^{-n}$ we have $P_k(n)=(-1)^kP_k(-n)$ which tells us that $P_k$ has the same parity as $k$. Now it remains to establish integrality of the coefficients. The explicit formula for $P_k$ can be rearranged as$$P_k(n)=\sum_{r\geq 1}\binom{k+r-1}{r,r-1,k-r}\frac{(2k-1)!}{2^{k-r}(k+r-1)!}(n)_r$$and from here it is clear that the coefficients of $P_k$ have nonnegative $p$-adic valuation for any odd prime $p$. It remains to show the following lemma Lemma: For any $k\geq r\geq 1$ we have$$\nu_2\left(\frac{(2k-1)!}{r!(r-1)!(k-r)!}\right)\geq k-r.$$ Proof We make use of the fact that $\nu_2\left(\frac{s!}{\lfloor\frac{s}{2}\rfloor!}\right)=\lfloor\frac{s}{2}\rfloor$. Our expression can be written as$$\nu_2\left(\frac{(2k-1)!}{r!(r-1)!(k-r)!}\right)=\nu_2 \left(\frac{(2k-1)!}{(k-1)!}\frac{\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor!\lfloor\frac{r-1}{2}\rfloor!}{r!(r-1)!}\right)+\nu_2\left(\binom{k-1}{\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor,\lfloor\frac{r-1}{2}\rfloor,k-r}\right)$$the first term is equal to $k-1-\lfloor\frac{r}{2}\rfloor-\lfloor\frac{r-1}{2}\rfloor=k-r$ and the second term is clearly nonnegative. This completes the proof of integrality.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/308178', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/25028/']}",jdg_77670

Question:
I want an NSView that can be resized by dragging its the bottom right corner around, just like an NSWindow. I want to be able to embed this NSView into a parent NSView. Is there a component like this in Cocoa or any of its extensions?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","If you get more specific with your question, I can get a little more specific with the answer. :-) There is nothing like this available that I know of, but it's not terribly difficult to create. The decision to make is ""who handles drawing the resize grips and resizing / dragging logic?"" Views Handle Their Own If your user-resizable view handles drawing the grips and responding to the resizing/dragging actions itself, then you have to choose whether you want the grips drawn atop the view's contents or ""around the outside."" If you want the grips ""outside,"" the ""usable area"" decreases because your content has to be inset enough to leave room for you to draw the resizing controls, which can complicate drawing and sizing metrics. If you draw the grips ""atop"" the content, you can avoid this problem. Container View Handles All Subviews The alternative is to create a ""resizable view container view"" that draws the resize grips around any subviews' perimeters and handles the dragging/resizing logic by ""bossing the subviews around"" when it (the container) receives dragging events on one of its grip areas. Placing the logic here allows any type of subview to be draggable / resizable and gives you the added benefit of only having one instance of the slightly-heavier-weight view (versus many instances of subviews that have the more complicated logic in them). The Basic Mechanism Once you've decided that, it's really just a matter of creating your subview, which does the drawing, manages NSTrackingArea instances (for the grip areas), and responds to the appropriate mouse methods (down, moved, etc.). In the case of each subview handling its own, they'll manage their own tracking areas, grip drawing, and mouse moved, setting their own frame in response. In the case of a container view handling all this for its subviews, it will manage all subviews' tracking areas and draw their grips on itself, and set the targeted subview's frame (and the subview is blissfully ignorant of the whole thing). I hope this helps give you at least a general idea of possible mechanisms. Had I not just gotten up and started my morning coffee, I'd probably be able to write this more succinctly, but there you have it. :-) EDIT 7 YEARS LATER Because there wasn't much detail about what the OP wanted, I gave a very generic answer, but I should make a few points: Always prefer an NSSplitView if it can be made to work for you (ie, if the views align with each other and divide the common container view's space). A split view lets you customize grip areas, etc. and does all of this to your subview for free. AutoLayout didn't exist when I wrote this answer and it greatly complicates rolling your own solution for the view-handling-multiple-sizable-subviews scenario. If you really do need a UI element that can be dragged/resized within some container, try your best to get away with using CALayers inside a master view that handles all the layout/sizing logic if you can. If you can't do the above (ie, the resizable view contains complex controls and layout, has its own NSViewController , etc.), try a hybrid approach (use layers to display cached images of non-selected views and only add a full, interactive sizable subview for the selected item (or subviews for items). Because of the complexities of AutoLayout, I really can't recommend the real draggable subview approach at all unless it's unavoidable. If you're designing a view that contains movable, sizable things, it's best (and most efficient) to make everything inside it that view's responsibility. Example: a graphics app with lots of shapes should have a Canvas view that represents the shapes (and any GUI decorations like size/drag grips, etc.) using CALayers . This takes advantage of graphics acceleration and is far more efficient than a bunch of (very resource-heavy) NSView subviews. All the move/size/select logic is handled by the ""Canvas View"" and the only subviews might be overlaid controls (though if your Canvas itself needs to be enclosed in a scroll view, it's best to use NSScrollView machinery to allow stationary overlay views for this purpose). If designing a view that draws lots of things (for which you should definitely use layers to represent those things) but allows selecting only one thing, the approach of adding a subview is manageable enough even with AutoLayout. If the ""selected for editing"" thing has lots of complex controls that become visible when editing, an ""editor subview"" with accompanying view controller makes sense and is a good tradeoff in maintainability (because view controller compartmentalizes all editing functionality/UI handling) vs. container view complexity (because one subview isn't going to break the resource bank and maintaining temporary AutoLayout constraints for keeping its position during container view resizes & editor interactions isn't overly complex). All of this assumes macOS; if designing for iOS, definitely bend over backwards to use layers and the new (as of this writing) drag and drop machinery, of which I know precious little at present. In summary, the answer was incomplete as well as somewhat outdated, so I feel my original advice isn't as good as it could be these days.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3899209', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/471356/']}",jdg_340352

Question:
I have an nginx container separate from my rails container and want to be able to serve precompiled assets from rails with the nginx container. This sounds like a job for a volume container but I have got myself confused after having quickly needing to learn docker and reading the documentation endlessly. Has anybody had to deal with a similar situation?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I'm having the same issue. Here's what I'm currently working on: Option 1: use a single image for both nginx and the app This way, I can build the image once (with the app, precompiled assets and nginx), then run two instances of it: one running the app server, and another for the nginx frontend: docker build -t hello .docker run --name hello-app hello rackupdocker run --name hello-web -p 80:80 --link hello-app:app hello nginx Not pretty, but very easy to set up and upgrade. Option 2: use a shared volume, and precompile assets as a job Shared volumes cannot be updated in the build process, but can be updated by a container instance. So we can run our rake task to precompile the assets just before running our app: docker build -t hello .docker run -v /apps/hello/assets:/app/public/assets hello rake assets:precompiledocker run --name hello-app hello rackupdocker run --name hello-web -p 80:80 --link hello-app:app -v /apps/hello/assets:/usr/share/nginx/html/assets nginx This looks like a more robust option, but will require a more complex instrumentation. I'm leaning towards this option, however, since we'll need a separate job for database migrations anyway. Option 3: distribute the assets to a CDN on build-time Your Dockerfile can upload the resulting assets directly to a CDN. Then you configure your Rails app to use it as the asset_host . Something like: RUN rake assets:precompile && aws s3 sync public/assets s3://test-assets/ I'm currently experimenting with this option. Since I'm using Amazon CloudFront, looks like I can just sync the resulting assets to S3 using the AWS CLI. There's also a gem for that ( asset_sync ), but it looks stale. The downside is that you'll have to send the needed AWS credentials to the build context or the Dockerfile itself – this might need committing them to your source repository, if you're using an automated build.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/28951133', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1613695/']}",jdg_186330

","In the original solution attempt: adjacent(_, _, []).adjacent(X, Y, [X, Y|Tail]) :-    adjacent(X,Y, Tail). As @ChristianHujer points out, the first clause should not be there because it isn't true. The empty list should have no adjacent elements. The second clause is also problematic. It shows that X and Y are adjacent in the list, but then recurses and doesn't just succeed. A proper clause should be: adjacent(X, Y, [X,Y|_]). Which says that X and Y are adjacent in the list if they're the first two elements in the list, regardless of what the tail is. This also forms a proper base case. Then your general, recursive clause should take care of the rest of the cases: adjacent(X, Y, [_|Tail]) :-    adjacent(X, Y, Tail). This says that X and Y are adjacent in [_|Tail] if they're adjacent in Tail . This takes care of the second problem you were encountering. Thus, the whole solution would be: adjacent(X, Y, [X,Y|_]).adjacent(X, Y, [_|Tail]) :-    adjacent(X, Y, Tail). This will succeed as many times as X and Y appear together, in that order, in the list.

Question:
If you continuously run your graphics card at between 80°C and 90°C (176°F and 194°F) is it actually bad for the graphics card? I.e. does it reduce the life of the card? Can this be proven? Or is it just assumptions? I understand that the safety shut off for GPUs is normally 90°C (194°F).

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Let us study the failure mechanisms, and see how they are affected by heat. It is very important to remember that just because a failure mechanism happens faster with temperature, the GPU will not necessarily fail faster! If a sub-component that lasts 100 years at room temperature only lasts 20 years if it is hot, but another sub-component only lasts 1 year to begin with (but is unaffected by heat), the lifespan of your product will hardly change with temperature. I will ignore the cycling issue talked about by Simeon as this is not my expertise. On the board-level, I can think of one main component that will 'break' with head: Electrolytic capacitors. These capacitors dry out, and it is well understood that they dry out faster when heat is applied. (tantalum capacitors also tend to have a shorter lifespan but I don't know how this changes with heat). But what about the silicon? Here, as I understand it, there are a few things that can cause failure. One of the main ones here is electromigration. In a circuit, the electrons going through bits of metal will actually physically move around atoms. This can get so bad that it will cause gaps in the conductors, which can then lead to failure. This image gives a good illustration (from Tatiana Kozlova, Henny W. Zandbergen; In situ TEM observation of electromigration in Ni nanobridges): This process increase exponentially with temperature, and thus indeed, the chip will last less time if temperature is higher and electromigration is the main cause of failure. Anther mechanism is oxide breakdown, where inside the circuit the transistors will suffer gate-punch-through. This is also temperature dependent. However, voltage has a much bigger impact here. There is also VT shift, either due to drift of dopants or due to hot-carrier-injection. Dopant drift increase with temperature (but unlikely to be an issue, esp. with digital circuits, as this is a very slow process). I am not sure about the temperature dependence of hot-carrier-injection, but I think again voltage is a much more important factor here. But then there is an important question: How much does this decrease the lifespan? Knowing this, should you make sure that your graphics card stays cool all the time?My guess is no, unless an error was made at the design stage. Circuits are designed with these worst-case situations in mind, and made such that they will survive if they are pushed to the limits for the rated lifetime of the manufacturer. In the case of people overclocking circuits: The increase in voltage they often use to keep the circuit stable (as it can speed the circuits up a bit) will do far more harm than the temperature itself. In addition, that increase in voltage will lead to an increase in current, which will significantly speed up electromigration issues.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/444474', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/224775/']}",jdg_88423

Easier to maintain, all database/cache handling is in each model Approach 2: Better performancewise - multiset/multiget is used More code required Harder to maintain Tell me what you think!

","Caching should be done in the model. If I had to choose in general, I would probably end up transparently caching the model's database interaction, which wouldn't require you to make any changes to the rest of your code. This of course would be done in the parent class of your models. Definitely focus on caching your database query results, as interfacing with your database is where you will see the most overhead. I would argue that it would be more efficient to cache your database results (or maybe your entire initialized model) more than anything else. Remember that you can serialize your objects before caching, so sending complex types (arrays or objects) into memcache shouldn't be a problem. PHP 5 provides the magic methods __sleep() and __wakeup() for the very purposes of seralizing and reconstructing your serialized objects. Caching full objects in PHP is basically a piece of cake. See http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php for more info.

Question:
The basic situation: There are multiple schools connected to a country wide network. (Some thousand schools.) We need to deliver e-learning content to them using a network that was created specifically for these schools. There are POPs in different counties, and all of these schools are accessing the internet through these points. Big part of the overall network traffic will be educational videos that are uploaded to Vimeo. Smaller part will be images, and finally static HTML/CSS files and REST API calls. These videos are embedded into web pages. (Pages representing lessons in online books.) We already have a business Vimeo account that allows us to embed videos into web pages, without displaying advertisements. Most schools will teach the same lesson at a given time, so they will need (about the) same videos at the same time. The total network traffic could be reduced effectively by caching these videos at the POPs. This is especially important, because the total bandwidth is not enough to stream videos to all clients simultaneously, without caching. But I'm not sure how to do this. Using squid would be a very good solution if we could install them separately for every school. Unfortunately, it is not possible. These schools do not have the infrastructure to operate a squid server 24/7, they have very different networks, with different devices and local admins have very different skills. It would probably be better to cache the content at the POPs. Here are some questions: What protocol is used for video streaming nowdays? What I see from the logs is that the player is downloading m4s files (mp4 video segments?) using HTTPS protocol. Is it possible to cache these videos transparently? If it uses https then it seems impossible to do (but I might be wrong). Can you suggest something that can reduce the required network bandwidth? It might be possible to write a special web page that plays these videos from a cache.

","Removing or creating a partition doesn't remove a data or a filesystem on a disk. It will only update the MBR or GPT information where partition lies and its size. Also, if the filesystem finds itself on the device which is larger than that is stored in its superblock, it will just work as if that was small device. Based on this knowledge, you can deduce the extension process. It is as follows: On a running system, run fdisk and carefully observe where the partition starts ( p ). Then remove it ( d ), and create ( n ) larger one on its place. Modern fdisk could ask about wiping signatures, if it will, say ""no"" (this is essential)! Pay special attention on its start, it must begin at exact same sector, but could have larger size. Exit fdisk writing changes ( w ). Filesystem could be left mounted. That will not broke access to data. In fact, kernel will refuse to reload partition table, because the old parition was in use, and it will use old parition mapping. To update a partition mapping in the kernel, you can simply reboot, or use kpartx or partprobe program in case service interruption is infeasible. Of course, you could have unmount filesystem in beforehand and remount after partition recreation, then kernel would not be blocked and partition mapping will be updated right after exit from fdisk. Resize a file system. Ext4 can be resized online (just resize2fs /dev/sdb1 , it will detect mounted filesystem and run online resize). Or you can again do this while it is unmounted, if you wish. Of course, this is still dangerous process.

Question:
Solution: I have marked @BlackRider's answer as correct as it is the most versatile especially for complex comparisons however there are other very good answers and comments. I would encourage anyone with the same or similar question to review them and evaluate the best course of action for your specific situation. In my situation, I am actually not using BlackRider's solution in my implementation. I have elected to use my own solution (see Edit #2 below) with help from @JoshCaswell's comments as well as @voromax's suggestion of indexesOfObjectsWithOptions:passingTest: due to the fact that my comparisons are very simple in this situation. Thanks to everyone who answered and provided insight. I am looking for an efficient way to retrieve an object from an NSArray based on a property of that object (a unique identifier, in this case). In C#.NET using Linq I would do something like MyObject obj = myList.Single(o => o.uuid == myUUID); I am also wondering if there is an efficient way to get an array of objects matching a non-unique property. Again, with Linq it would look like List<MyObject> objs = myList.Where(o => o.flag == true).ToList(); Of course I can write loops to do this but they would not be reusable and I'm suspicious of their performance. Finding an object with a unique ID: -(MyObject*)findObjectWithUUID:(NSString*)searchUUID{    for (MyObject* obj in _myArray){        if([obj.uuid isEqualToString: searchUUID])            return obj;    }} Finding an array of objects: -(NSArray*)findObjectsWithFlag:(BOOL)f{    NSMutableArray* arr = [NSMutableArray array];    for (MyObject* obj in _myArray){        if(obj.flag == f)            [arr addObject:obj];    }    return arr;} -- EDIT -- Luckily in the first situation the object I am looking for has a unique identifier and I know there will only be one. I came up with a solution to implement isEqual on my object which will be invoked by indexOfObject: - (BOOL)isEqual:(id)object{    return [self.uuid isEqualToString: ((MyObject*)object).uuid];} And then create a ""fake"" lookup object and use that to find the real one MyObject *lookupObject = [[MyObject alloc] init];lookupObject.uuid = searchUUID;MyObject *actualObject =     [_myArray objectAtIndex:[_myArray indexOfObject:lookupObject]]; This is essentially the same as the for-in loop I posted above, but might be more readable & be more reusable. Of course, this only works for finding one unique object and does not address the second half of my question. -- EDIT 2 -- Checking Class and implementing hash as recommended in comments. - (BOOL)isEqual:(id)object{    return [object isKindOfClass:[MyObject class]] &&            [self.uuid isEqualToString: ((MyObject*)object).uuid];}- (NSUInteger)hash{    return [self.uuid hash];}

My end goal is to have an array of structures that i can iterate through and perform testing on.  Is there any way I can define a generic structure and then create instances of it? Should I use some other mechanism.  I know MATLAB supports Java, should I use a class/interface?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You mentioned your goal was to work with several structure of the same type, therefore you should be aware of the main two approaches available to you and how they compare: 1) array of structures You can initialize it by growing the array dynamically p(1).str = 'white';p(1).r = 1;p(1).g = 1;p(1).b = 1;p(2).str = 'black';p(2).r = 0;p(2).g = 0;p(2).b = 0; However its always better to start by pre-allocating the array p = repmat( struct('r',[], 'g',[], 'b',[], 'str',[]), 1, 10); another trick to pre-allocate: p(10) = struct('r',[], 'g',[], 'b',[], 'str',[]); Or even give all values at initialization: p = struct('r',{1 0}, 'g',{1 0}, 'b',{1 0}, 'str',{'white' 'black'}); A simple way to fill values names = {'white' 'black'};[p(1:2).str] = names{:};red = num2cell([1 0]);[p(1:2).r] = red{:}; Here's how you retrieve all values of one field: red = [p(:).r];names = {p(:).str}; 2) structures of arrays p.r = [1 0];p.g = [1 0];p.b = [1 0];p.str = {'white' 'black'};p1 = [p.r(1) p.g(1) p.b(1)]; The advantage of this is that the structure is simply an array of pointer (r,g,b,str are stored separately in memory). Compare this to the previous approach, where we have an array of structure, and each structure has pointers to its field (there's quite a memory overhead): >> s1 = repmat( struct('r',0, 'g',0, 'b',0), 1, 1000);>> s2 = struct('r',zeros(1,1000), 'g',zeros(1,1000), 'b',zeros(1,1000));>> whos  Name      Size               Bytes  Class     Attributes  s1        1x1000            204192  struct                s2        1x1                24372  struct On the other hand, since each of the fields of a structure is stored as an array of its own, it is up to you to enforce the fact that they have to match in length.

Question:
I want the background colour of a WPF datagrid cell to change colour when the contents have been modified. Each cell has behind it a ViewModel object which contains the following properties - Value, OriginalValue and Modified. When the user edits the cell contents, this automatically triggers the Amount property via data binding. This property setter then checks it against the original value and sets the boolean Modified property to true or false respectively, notifies the bindings for those properties to update. I have so far achieved a partial result with a Style on the ElementStyle property of the DataGridTextColumn as follows <Style x:Key=""DataGridTextStyle"" TargetType=""{x:Type TextBlock}"">    <Style.Triggers>        <DataTrigger Binding=""{Binding Path=MyViewModel.Modified}"" Value=""True"">            <Setter Property=""Background"" Value=""Yellow""/>        </DataTrigger>    </Style.Triggers></Style> This updates the text content background colour, but that is only a small area in the center of the cell. I want the entire cell to updates it's background colour, not just the textblock attribute. Can I modify the above trigger to search upwards in the visual tree to find a parent DataGridCell and set the Background property on that, rather than setting the background colour of the current textblock only?

Question:
I want to know if ""if-statements"" inside shaders (vertex / fragment / pixel...) are really slowing down the shader performance. For example: Is it better to use this: vec3 output;output = input*enable + input2*(1-enable); instead of using this: vec3 output;if(enable == 1){    output = input;}else{    output = input2;} in another forum there was a talk about that (2013): http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/442688/shader-if-else-performance.html Here the guys are saying, that the If-statements are really bad for the performance of the shader. Also here they are talking about how much is inside the if/else statements (2012): https://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/showthread.php/177762-Performance-alternative-for-if-(-) maybe the hardware or the shadercompiler are better now and they fix somehow this (maybe not existing) performance issue. EDIT: What is with this case, here lets say enable is a uniform variable and it is always set to 0: if(enable == 1) //never happens{    output = vec4(0,0,0,0);}else  //always happens{    output = calcPhong(normal, lightDir);} I think here we have a branch inside the shader which slows the shader down. Is that correct? Does it make more sense to make 2 different shaders like one for the else and the other for the if part?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","What is it about shaders that even potentially makes if statements performance problems? It has to do with how shaders get executed and where GPUs get their massive computing performance from. Separate shader invocations are usually executed in parallel, executing the same instructions at the same time. They're simply executing them on different sets of input values; they share uniforms, but they have different internal registers. One term for a group of shaders all executing the same sequence of operations is ""wavefront"". The potential problem with any form of conditional branching is that it can screw all that up. It causes different invocations within the wavefront to have to execute different sequences of code. That is a very expensive process, whereby a new wavefront has to be created, data copied over to it, etc. Unless... it doesn't. For example, if the condition is one that is taken by every invocation in the wavefront, then no runtime divergence is needed. As such, the cost of the if is just the cost of checking a condition. So, let's say you have a conditional branch, and let's assume that all of the invocations in the wavefront will take the same branch. There are three possibilities for the nature of the expression in that condition: Compile-time static. The conditional expression is entirely based off of compile-time constants. As such, you know from looking at the code which branches will be taken. Pretty much any compiler handles this as part of basic optimization. Statically uniform branching. The condition is based off of expressions involving things which are known at compile-time to be constant (specifically, constants and uniform values). But the value of the expression will not be known at compile-time. So the compiler can statically be certain that wavefronts will never be broken by this if , but the compiler cannot know which branch will be taken. Dynamic branching. The conditional expression contains terms other than constants and uniforms. Here, a compiler cannot tell a priori if a wavefront will be broken up or not. Whether that will need to happen depends on the runtime evaluation of the condition expression. Different hardware can handle different branching types without divergence. Also, even if a condition is taken by different wavefronts, the compiler could restructure the code to not require actual branching . You gave a fine example: output = input*enable + input2*(1-enable); is functionally equivalent to the if statement. A compiler could detect that an if is being used to set a variable, and thus execute both sides. This is frequently done for cases of dynamic conditions where the bodies of the branches are small. Pretty much all hardware can handle var = bool ? val1 : val2 without having to diverge. This was possible way back in 2002. Since this is very hardware-dependent, it... depends on the hardware. There are however certain epochs of hardware that can be looked at: Desktop, Pre-D3D10 There, it's kinda the wild west. NVIDIA's compiler for such hardware was notorious for detecting such conditions and actually recompiling your shader whenever you changed uniforms that affected such conditions. In general, this era is where about 80% of the ""never use if statements"" comes from. But even here, it's not necessarily true. You can expect optimization of static branching. You can hope that statically uniform branching won't cause any additional slowdown (though the fact that NVIDIA thought recompilation would be faster than executing it makes it unlikely at least for their hardware). But dynamic branching is going to cost you something, even if all of the invocations take the same branch. Compilers of this era do their best to optimize shaders so that simple conditions can be executed simply. For example, your output = input*enable + input2*(1-enable); is something that a decent compiler could generate from your equivalent if statement. Desktop, Post-D3D10 Hardware of this era is generally capable of handling statically uniform branches statements with little slowdown. For dynamic branching, you may or may not encounter slowdown. Desktop, D3D11+ Hardware of this era is pretty much guaranteed to be able to handle dynamically uniform conditions with little performance issues. Indeed, it doesn't even have to be dynamically uniform; so long as all of the invocations within the same wavefront take the same path, you won't see any significant performance loss. Note that some hardware from the previous epoch probably could do this as well. But this is the one where it's almost certain to be true. Mobile, ES 2.0 Welcome back to the wild west. Though unlike Pre-D3D10 desktop, this is mainly due to the huge variance of ES 2.0-caliber hardware. There's such a huge amount of stuff that can handle ES 2.0, and they all work very differently from each other. Static branching will likely be optimized. But whether you get good performance from statically uniform branching is very hardware-dependent. Mobile, ES 3.0+ Hardware here is rather more mature and capable than ES 2.0. As such, you can expect statically uniform branches to execute reasonably well. And some hardware can probably handle dynamic branches the way modern desktop hardware does.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 9, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/37827216', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/3567987/']}",jdg_300367

Question:
I'd love to create a ""back"" left-arrow-bezel button in a UIToolbar . As far as I can tell, the only way to get one of these is to leave UINavigationController at default settings and it uses one for the left bar item. But there's no way I can find to create one as a UIBarButtonItem , so I can't make one in a standard UIToolbar , even though they're very similar to UINavigationBar s. I could manually create it with button images, but I can't find the source images anywhere. They have alpha-channel edges, so screenshotting and cutting won't get very versatile results. Any ideas beyond screenshotting for every size and color scheme I intend to use? Update: PLEASE STOP dodging the question and suggesting that I shouldn't be asking this and should be using UINavigationBar . My app is Instapaper Pro. It shows only a bottom toolbar (to save space and maximize readable content area), and I wish to put a left-arrow-shaped Back button in the bottom.

Question:
Does it open the possibility of new baryonic matter/atoms being created in the universe and avoiding the Heat Death of the universe?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","In this answer, I'll discuss the global average state of the matter in the universe, as described by cosmological models such as lambda-CDM models, which assume homogeneity and isotropy. That means that I'm not discussing extreme fluctuations or things like Boltzmann brains, which AVS's answer talks about. Does the fact that energy is not conserved in cosmology opens the possibility of new matter/atoms being created in the universe? Creating new baryonic matter is something that was considered seriously in the context of the steady state model, which was advocated by Hoyle, Bondi, and Gold up until about the mid-1960's, when evidence for a hot big bang killed the steady state model off. One of the problems with steady state models was that they had to violate Lorentz invariance, since there had to be some preferred state of motion for the newly created hydrogen atoms. (They also violate the charge conjugation and time reversal symmetries.) You're right that mass-energy is not globally conserved in general relativity, but it is exactly locally conserved in the sense that the divergence $\nabla_a T^a{}_b$ of the stress-energy tensor is zero. Our universe is currently pretty well approximated by the de Sitter spacetime, and is expected to remain so forever, according to current theories. For simplicity, let's suppose for the moment that the geometry of the universe has to be exactly de Sitter. This was what Hoyle et al. wanted, because they wanted all eras of the universe to look the same, and the de Sitter universe is the only cosmological model that has this symmetry. This seems pretty similar to the physical motivation for your question, which was whether it would be possible for the universe to avoid a fate in which there was basically nothing there but dark energy. For the de Sitter spacetime the divergence of the stress-energy tensor has a timelike component equal to $$\frac{\dot{a}}{a}(\rho+P),$$ where $a$ is the scale factor describing cosmological expansion, $\rho$ is the mass-energy density, and $P$ is the pressure. (This is all in units where $c=1$.) For this reason, we must have $$\rho+P=0$$ everywhere. Dark energy satisfies this condition, but baryonic matter doesn't. Therefore it is not possible for new baryonic matter to be created in cosmological expansion, in the de Sitter spacetime. If you're a wily theoretician like Hoyle and you look for a way to escape this constraint, there is a way out, which is to posit the existence of a field with $\rho=0$ and $P<0$. Hoyle called this the C field. Then if you add the contributions to the stress-energy from the C field and baryonic matter, you can end up with $\rho+P=0$. Although dark energy is currently the dominant form of mass-energy in the universe, realistic cosmological models do incorporate other matter fields, including baryonic matter. These models therefore do not have exactly the geometry of de Sitter space. That complicates things compared to the argument given above, but the conclusion is still the same. According to these models, you can't have the production of new baryonic matter without violating local conservation of mass-energy, which is baked in to the structure of general relativity. If you try to construct a model that produces new baryonic matter without violating local conservation of mass-energy, then as far as I know you are uniquely led to something like Hoyle's ""C-field"" theory, and then you have all the problems of that theory, including violation of Lorentz invariance and incompatibility with observations such as the cosmic microwave background. For more information on (failed) attempts to reconcile such theories with modern knowledge, see this web page by Ned Wright. I also have a mathematical discussion of the steady-state model in section 8.4 of my own GR book . What raised my question is the idea of Eternal Inflation. New matter is being created in the newly created bubble universes. Of course this is highly speculative but as a layman I wonder if it’s possible since energy is not conserved. Energy is locally conserved. It's just not globally conserved.

Given $\lambda$ an integer partition of $n$ , let $h_{ij}(\lambda)$ denote the hook length of cell $(i,j)$ in the Young diagram of $\lambda$ . Is there a closed formula or a generating function for the following sequence? $$f_n=\sum_{\lambda\vdash n}\sum_{(i,j)\in\lambda}(-1)^{i+j}\cdot h_{ij}(\lambda)$$

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The hook length $h_{ij}(\lambda)$ counts the number of boxes directly below or directly to the right of box $(i,j)$ . (I picture the Young diagram of $\lambda$ as having the corner $(0,0)$ located in the upper left.) With this in mind, the alternating sum $\sum_{(i,j)\in \lambda}(-1)^{i+j}h_{ij}(\lambda)$ can be expanded as a signed sum over all the boxes in $\lambda$ . We see that a box $(i,j)$ contributes $+1$ if both $i,j$ are even, $-1$ if both $i,j$ are odd, and $0$ otherwise. Using this description we see that $$\sum_{(i,j)\in \lambda}(-1)^{i+j}h_{ij}(\lambda)=\left\lceil \frac{\lambda_1}{2}\right\rceil-\left\lfloor\frac{\lambda_2}{2}\right\rfloor+\left\lceil \frac{\lambda_3}{2}\right\rceil-\left\lfloor\frac{\lambda_4}{2}\right\rfloor+\cdots$$ where $\lambda=(\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \dots)$ . Now we can use a wonderful formula due to Boulet (Theorem 1 in ""A Four-parameter Partition Identity"" ) which tells us (after the appropriate specialization) $$\sum_{\lambda}x^{\sum_{(i,j)\in \lambda}(-1)^{i+j}h_{ij}(\lambda)}q^{|\lambda|}=\prod_{k\geq 1}\frac{(1+xq^{4k-1})(1+xq^{4k-3})}{(1-q^{4k})(1-xq^{4k-2})^2}$$ I will call this two variable generating function $H(x,q)$ . The generating function $F(q)=\sum_{n\geq 0}f_nq^n$ is given by $$F(q)=\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial x} H(x,q)\right]_{x=1}$$ therefore we start by computing $$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} H(x,q)=H(x,q)\sum_{k\geq 1}\left(\frac{q^{4k-1}}{1+xq^{4k-1}}+\frac{2q^{4k-2}}{1-xq^{4k-2}}+\frac{q^{4k-3}}{1+xq^{4k-3}}\right)$$ and finally setting $x=1$ gives $$F(q)=\left(\prod_{k\geq 1}\frac{1}{1-q^k}\right)\cdot\left(\sum_{n\geq 1}A_nq^n\right)$$ where $\sum_{n\geq 1}A_{n}q^n=\sum_k\left(\frac{q^{4k-1}}{1+q^{4k-1}}+\frac{2q^{4k-2}}{1-q^{4k-2}}+\frac{q^{4k-3}}{1+q^{4k-3}}\right)$ . If we expand this last sum, the terms simplify a little bit to give $\sum_{n\geq 1}A_n q^n=\sum_{k\geq 1}\frac{q^{2k-1}}{1-q^{2k-1}}$ .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/389172', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/66131/']}",jdg_165673

Question:
I'm sure many people will respond with links to 'let me google that for you', so I want to say that I've tried to figure this out so please forgive my lack of understanding here, but I cannot figure out how the practical implementation of a neural network actually works. I understand the input layer and how to normalize the data, I also understand the bias unit, but when it comes to the hidden layer, what the actual computation is in that layer, and how it maps to the output is just a little foggy. I've seen diagrams with question marks in the hidden layer, boolean functions like AND/OR/XOR, activation functions, and input nodes that map to all of the hidden units and input nodes that map to only a few hidden units each and so I just have a few questions on the practical aspect. Of course, a simple explanation of the entire neural network process like you would explain to a child, would be awesome. What computations are done in the hidden layer? How are those computations mapped to the output layer? How does the ouput layer work? De-normalizing the data from the hidden layer? Why are some layers in the input layer connected to the hidden layer and some are not?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Three sentence version: Each layer can apply any function you want to the previous layer (usually a linear transformation followed by a squashing nonlinearity). The hidden layers' job is to transform the inputs into something that the output layer can use. The output layer transforms the hidden layer activations into whatever scale you wanted your output to be on. Like you're 5: If you want a computer to tell you if there's a bus in a picture, the computer might have an easier time if it had the right tools. So your bus detector might be made of a wheel detector (to help tell you it's a vehicle) and a box detector (since the bus is shaped like a big box) and a size detector (to tell you it's too big to be a car).  These are the three elements of your hidden layer: they're not part of the raw image, they're tools you designed to help you identify busses. If all three of those detectors turn on (or perhaps if they're especially active), then there's a good chance you have a bus in front of you. Neural nets are useful because there are good tools (like backpropagation) for building lots of detectors and putting them together. Like you're an adult A feed-forward neural network applies a series of functions to the data.  The exact functions will depend on the neural network you're using: most frequently, these functions each compute a linear transformation of the previous layer, followed by a squashing nonlinearity.  Sometimes the functions will do something else (like computing logical functions in your examples, or averaging over adjacent pixels in an image).  So the roles of the different layers could depend on what functions are being computed, but I'll try to be very general. Let's call the input vector $x$, the hidden layer activations $h$, and the output activation $y$.  You have some function $f$ that maps from $x$ to $h$ and another function $g$ that maps from $h$ to $y$. So the hidden layer's activation is $f(x)$ and the output of the network is $g(f(x))$. Why have two functions ($f$ and $g$) instead of just one? If the level of complexity per function is limited, then $g(f(x))$ can compute things that $f$ and $g$ can't do individually. An example with logical functions: For example, if we only allow $f$ and $g$ to be simple logical operators like ""AND"", ""OR"", and ""NAND"", then you can't compute other functions like ""XOR"" with just one of them.  On the other hand, we could compute ""XOR"" if we were willing to layer these functions on top of each other: First layer functions: Make sure that at least one element is ""TRUE"" (using OR) Make sure that they're not all ""TRUE"" (using NAND) Second layer function: Make sure that both of the first-layer criteria are satisfied (using AND) The network's output is just the result of this second function.  The first layer transforms the inputs into something that the second layer can use so that the whole network can perform XOR. An example with images: Slide 61 from this talk --also available here as a single image--shows (one way to visualize) what the different hidden layers in a particular neural network are looking for. The first layer looks for short pieces of edges in the image: these are very easy to find from raw pixel data, but they're not very useful by themselves for telling you if you're looking at a face or a bus or an elephant. The next layer composes the edges: if the edges from the bottom hidden layer fit together in a certain way, then one of the eye-detectors in the middle of left-most column might turn on.  It would be hard to make a single layer that was so good at finding something so specific from the raw pixels: eye detectors are much easier to build out of edge detectors than out of raw pixels. The next layer up composes the eye detectors and the nose detectors into faces.  In other words, these will light up when the eye detectors and nose detectors from the previous layer turn on with the right patterns.  These are very good at looking for particular kinds of faces: if one or more of them lights up, then your output layer should report that a face is present. This is useful because face detectors are easy to build out of eye detectors and nose detectors, but really hard to build out of pixel intensities. So each layer gets you farther and farther from the raw pixels and closer to your ultimate goal (e.g. face detection or bus detection). Answers to assorted other questions ""Why are some layers in the input layer connected to the hidden layer and some are not?"" The disconnected nodes in the network are called ""bias"" nodes. There's a really nice explanation here . The short answer is that they're like intercept terms in regression. ""Where do the ""eye detector"" pictures in the image example come from?"" I haven't double-checked the specific images I linked to, but in general, these visualizations show the set of pixels in the input layer that maximize the activity of the corresponding neuron.  So if we think of the neuron as an eye detector, this is the image that the neuron considers to be most eye-like.  Folks usually find these pixel sets with an optimization (hill-climbing) procedure. In this paper by some Google folks with one of the world's largest neural nets, they show a ""face detector"" neuron and a ""cat detector"" neuron this way, as well as a second way: They also show the actual images that activate the neuron most strongly (figure 3, figure 16).  The second approach is nice because it shows how flexible and nonlinear the network is--these high-level ""detectors"" are sensitive to all these images, even though they don't particularly look similar at the pixel level. Let me know if anything here is unclear or if you have any more questions.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 9, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/63152', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/17679/']}",jdg_151363

Question:
I have a Facebook application that uses the Facebook Connect.js . I am running my application over HTTPS. All content on the site is delivered from https:// with the exception of some content that must be included within Facebook's Connect.js The problem is that I get warning messages saying that there are non-secure items within the page. I've checked what scripts are being loaded using Chrome 's Developer Tools / Network tab to see what files are being loaded and from where. The only one I can see that is being loaded over HTTP and not over HTTPS is a file called http://static.ak.facebook.com/connect/canvas_proxy.php . How can I force this file to use HTTPS?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","TL;DR set FB._https to true before calling FB.init . Like so: FB._https = true;FB.init({    /* your app id and stuff */}); Explanation If you unminify the Facebook JavaScript SDK, you'll see that its basically an object literal with a bunch of properties. One of these properties is _https , which is a boolean. This property determines which set of URLs to use (stored in FB._domain ) when making API requests. It seems as though Facebook keeps two sets of URLs for each type of API request -- a secure URL and and non-secure URL -- then uses a switch function called getDomain() to determine which to use when making requests. The reason the JavaScript SDK causes security warnings is due to the way the FB._https property is defined. This is how it's currently defined as of 2011-8-24: _https: (window.name.indexOf('_fb_https') > -1) Apparently Facebook thinks that if the window.name property has _fb_https in it, then it must be a secure app. This is obviously incorrect. The real test should be something similar to this: _https: window.location.protocol == ""https:"" Unfortunately, the SDK is not open source or even well documented, so I can't submit a pull request for this change :P. In the short term, setting FB._https to true manually before calling FB.init should do the trick.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/5212016', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/156406/']}",jdg_213486

Question:
I am developing an application which has a client-server relationship, and I am having trouble deciding on the algorithm by which the session identifier is determined.  My goal is to restrict imposters from acquiring other users' private data. I'm considering two options: Option 1: Generate a random 32-character hex string, store it in a database, and pass it from the server to the client upon successful client login.  The client then stores this identifier and uses it in any future request to the server, which would cross-check it with the stored identifier. Option 2: Create a hash from a combination of the session's start time and the client's login username and/or hashed password and use it for all future requests to the server.  The session hash would be stored in a database upon the first request, and cross-checked for any future request from the client. Other info: Multiple clients can be connected from the same IP simultaneously, and no two clients should have the same session identifier. Question: Which of these options is a better approach, with regards to my concerns (below) about each? My concern over the first option is that the identifier is completely random and therefore could be replicated by chance (although it's a 1 in a 3.4 * 10 38 chance), and used to ""steal"" one user's (who would also need to be using the client at the time) private data. My concern over the second option is that it has a security flaw, namely that if a user's hashed password is intercepted somehow, the entire session hash could be duped and the user's private data could be stolen. Thanks for any and all input.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The basic concept of a session identifier is that it is a short-lived secret name for the session , a dynamic relationship which is under the control of the server (i.e. under the control of your code). It is up to you to decide when sessions starts and stop. The two security characteristics of a successful session identifier generation algorithm are: No two distinct sessions shall have the same identifier, with overwhelming probability. It should not be computationally feasible to ""hit"" a session identifier when trying random ones, with non-negligible probability. These two properties are achieved with a random session ID of at least, say, 16 bytes (32 characters with hexadecimal representation), provided that the generator is a cryptographically strong PRNG ( /dev/urandom on Unix-like systems, CryptGenRandom() on Windows/Win32, RNGCryptoServiceProvider on .NET...). Since you also store the session ID in a database server side, you could check for duplicates, and indeed your database will probably do it for you (you will want this ID to be an index key), but that's still time wasted because the probability is very low. Consider that every time you get out of your house, you are betting on the idea that you will not get struck by lightning. Getting killed by lightning has probability about 3*10 -10 per day ( really ). That's a life threatening risk , your own life, to be precise. And yet you dismiss that risk, without ever thinking about it. What sense does it make, then, to worry about session ID collisions which are millions of times less probable, and would not kill anybody if they occurred ? There is little point in throwing an extra hash function in the thing. Properly applied randomness will already give you all the uniqueness you need. Added complexity can only result in added weaknesses. Cryptographic functions are relevant in a scenario where you not only want to have session, but you also want to avoid any server-based storage cost; say, you have no database on the server. This kind of state offloading requires a MAC and possibly encryption (see this answer for some details).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/24850', 'https://security.stackexchange.com', 'https://security.stackexchange.com/users/16679/']}",jdg_380927

Question:
I seem to not be able to do this (which I used to be able to do in Python). Let me explain .. Suppose I have the following method in Ruby: def someMethod(arg1=1,arg2=2,arg3=3).........end Now to call this method I could do someMethod(2,3,4)someMethod(2,3)someMethod(2) and the arguments are taken by their respective order.. but what if I want to give arg2 at some point in my programming and want the default values for arg1 and arg3? I tried writing someMethod(arg2=4) but this doesn't seem to work in Ruby 1.9.  What it does is it still thinks that arg1 is 4. In python I could at least get away with this, but in ruby I am not sure. Does anyone have any elegant ideas?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Only elegant solution for now is to use hash as parameters list: def some_method(options = {})  defaults = {:arg1 => 1, :arg2 => 2, :arg3 => 3}  options = defaults.merge(options)  ...end and later in code use implicit hash when calling your method: some_method()some_method(:arg1 => 2, :arg2 => 3, :arg3 => 4)some_method(:arg2 => 4) In Ruby 1.9 you can use new hash keys syntax to get ir more like in Python: some_method(arg1: 2, arg2: 3, arg3: 4) If you want simpler syntax and still be able to use positional parameters, then I would suggest to play with something like this: def some_method(*args)  defaults = {:arg1 => 1, :arg2 => 2, :arg3 => 3}  options = args.last.is_a?(::Hash) ? args.pop : {}  options = defaults.merge(options)  arg1 = args[0] || options[:arg1]  arg2 = args[1] || options[:arg2]  arg3 = args[2] || options[:arg3]  ...endsome_method()some_method(2)some_method(3,4,5)some_method(arg2: 5)some_method(2, arg3: 10) If you would like to mimic Ruby arguments number check for method, you can add: fail ""Unknown parameter name(s) "" + (options.keys - defaults.keys).join("", "") + ""."" unless options.length == defaults.length EDIT: I updated my answer with Jonas Elfström 's comment",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2371044', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/206717/']}",jdg_257928

Question:
This is a follow-up question to this question . Let's say we want to minimize the following function f wrt. x and y . The approach is to minimize first wrt. to y and then wrt. x . If this approach makes sense is not part of the question. f[x_, y_] := (x - 2)^2 + x ( y - 2)^2dx[x_, y_] := Block[{xs}, D[f[xs, y], xs] /. xs -> x]dy[x_, y_] := Block[{ys}, D[f[x, ys], ys] /. ys -> y]fy[x_?NumericQ] := y /. FindRoot[dy[x, y] == 0, {y, 20}]dxnoy[x_] := dx[x, fy[x]] Now using FindRoot on dxnoy yields the correct result: FindRoot[{dxnoy[x] == 0}, {{x, 5}}](* {x -> 2.} *) However, the process seems to be inefficient. Using EvaluationMonitor in FindRoot reveals that the exact same points x are evaluated multiple times: Last[Reap[FindRoot[{dxnoy[x] == 0}, {{x, 5}}, EvaluationMonitor :> Sow[x]]]](* {{5., 5., 5., 2., 2., 2.}} *) Why is that? Or better: How can it be avoided? It seems to me that the performance could be a factor 3 better if it wouldn't evaluate the points x=5 and x=2 three times each.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I speculate that the following is occurring.  As I noted in a comment above, the actual values of x returned by EvaluationMonitor are Last[Reap[FindRoot[{dxnoy[x] == 0}, {{x, 5}}, EvaluationMonitor :> Sow[{x}]]]]NumberForm[%, 25](* {{{5.}, {5.}, {5.000000074505806}, {2.}, {2.}, {2.0000000298023224}}} *) To use the ""Newton"" method, FindRoot must evaluate both the dxnoy[x] and its derivative at each point.  Since FindRoot cannot see inside dxnoy[x] , it must evaluate the derivative numerically.  This would seem to account for the second evaluation at x == 5. , followed by the evaluation at x == 5.000000074505806.  It then does the same at x == 2 .  Convergence is rapid, because dxnoy[x] is quadratic.  Evaluation of the derivative numerically at x == 2. can be avoided by Last[Reap[FindRoot[{dxnoy[x] == 0}, {{x, 5}}, EvaluationMonitor :> Sow[{x}],     Method -> {""Newton"", ""UpdateJacobian"" -> 2}]]]NumberForm[%, 25](* {{{5.}, {5.}, {5.000000074505806}, {2.}}} *) The second evaluation at x == 5. still seems unnecessary.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/131913', 'https://mathematica.stackexchange.com', 'https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/38410/']}",jdg_74689

Question:
I've got mod_rpaf installed to get the user's IP address from the X-Forwarded-For header in PHP, Apache logs, etc. Unfortunately, it looks like I have to explicitly set which IPs that header will be respected from via the RPAFproxy_ips setting. Given that ELBs don't have a static IP, how can I tell mod_rpaf to accept the header from any IP, or even any 10.* IP?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You can try to use mod_extract_forwarded instead of mod_rpaf — it supports MEFaccept all (and if you use RHEL/CentOS/other-clone, the package is already in EPEL). One downside of mod_extract_forwarded is that the X-Forwarded-For and Forwarded-For header names are hardcoded and not configurable like in mod_rpaf . There is no support for IP ranges even in mod_extract_forwarded , but you may configure a firewall to allow direct access to Apache only from some IP ranges, or check the MEF_RPROXY_ADDR environment variable in mod_rewrite rules. After some more thinking about this I found a problem with this mod_extract_forwarded config — while mod_rpaf does not support chains of multiple proxies and takes just the last address from the X-Forwarded-For header, mod_extract_forwarded attempts to support this and uses the last address which does not belong to the trusted proxy list (so that if the request has passed through multiple trusted proxies, the actual client address will be used instead of the second-to-last proxy address).  Unfortunately, using MEFaccept all means that mod_extract_forwarded will trust all proxies, therefore if ELB proxies just append their data to the X-Forwarded-For header, and not replace it completely, clients could pass any spoofed IP by sending requests with their own X-Forwarded-For headers. However, I have found yet another module to parse X-Forwarded-For headers.  Recent (unstable) Apache versions have the mod_remoteip module, which apparently supports subnet masks for proxy addresses.  There is a backport to Apache 2.2 and a spec file for Fedora ; unfortunately, the request to include package in Fedora is stalled.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://serverfault.com/questions/329893', 'https://serverfault.com', 'https://serverfault.com/users/584/']}",jdg_139630

Question:
I have virtually no experience with python, but I am trying to create a simple script which loads an image and uses the slider widget to adjust the minimum and maximum of the colorbar, and redraws the image data accordingly. I am trying to follow this example: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/widgets/slider_demo.html . I have tried to just change the plot command to imshow, and to use the slider values to set the clim of my image. However I get the following error message, from the call 'im1,=ax.imshow' (on line 12 in the code below): 'AxesImage' object is not iterable I don't understand what this call does, but apparently it can not be used with imshow(). If I remove the comma in that call, I get no errors, but the image does not update when the sliders are changed. Does anyone have an alternative solution, or an explanation of why this does not work?

Question:
In the same way as there are electromagnetic and gravitational waves that update the information on their respective field, is there an analogue for the weak and strong forces?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","No, there are no weak or strong waves in the sense as there are for electromagnetic or gravitational waves. The electromagnetic and gravitational waves are classical objects, they are possible vacuum solutions to the classical equation of motion for the field strength of the respective force, and can be radiated by objects charged under the respective force. But the weak and the strong force have no analogous classical limits - the weak force is suppressed by a factor $\mathrm{e}^{-\mu r}$ due to the mass of the W- and Z-bosons and thus very different from the EM or gravitational force, and it doesn't make sense to speak of a classical limit of the strong force because gluons and quarks are confined - there are no net charges under the strong force on a classical level, hence the strong force just vanished from our description. In other words, the weak and the strong force are, in some sense, ""fully quantum"" in that their importance to our world comes completely from their quantized description, and a classical description does not make sense for them, thus we cannot speak of a classical concept such as a wave for the weak and strong forces.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/223424', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/37677/']}",jdg_350124

Question:
Can anybody tell what's the problem of the code below? int main () {     return main(); } I tested, it compiles correctly. It's running forever. Anymore trick behind the scene?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","TLDR : Calling main results in undefined behavior. There seems to be confusion about the terminology used in the standard, and the implications that has for the programmer and compiler. Firstly, the standard alone determines everything about the C++ language. If your particular version of a particular compiler allows some particular action, that has no bearing on whether or not that action is legal. For the remainder of the post, I'm referring to the ISO03 standard. So to quote once again, the standard says in §3.6.1.3: The function main shall not be used within a program. Additionally, §3.2 defines ""used"" as: An object or non-overloaded function is used if its name appears in a potentially-evaluated expression. This means that once the program begins executing, main should never be entered again . That means programmers cannot call main , that means the compiler cannot insert another call to main (why it would, who knows), you cannot take the address of main and call that, etc. You cannot even have the potential of calling main . The only call to main should be by the run-time library the program is running on; all other calls invoke undefined behavior. (Which means anything could happen!) Now onto compiler behavior: A diagnosable rule is defined as (§1.4.1): The set of diagnosable rules consists of all syntactic and semantic rules in this International Standard except for those rules containing an explicit notation that “no diagnostic is required” or which are described as resulting in “undefined behavior.” In our case, §3.6.1.3 defines a diagnosable rule. Here's what compilers should do according to §1.4.2: — If a program contains no violations of the rules in this International Standard, a conforming implementation shall, within its resource limits, accept and correctly execute3) that program. — If a program contains a violation of any diagnosable rule, a conforming implementation shall issue at least one diagnostic message, except that — If a program contains a violation of a rule for which no diagnostic is required, this International Standard places no requirement on implementations with respect to that program. So compilers are not required to enforce rules. All compilers have to do is take well-formed programs (§1.3.14) and turn them into an executable program. A compiler is free to warn, error, etc. however it likes, as long as it does not conflict with the language. It is required to display a message in our particular case, according to the second clause. For this particular problem, on gcc the -pedantic option will warn about the illegality of calling main within the program. Visual Studio will not warn about calling main , but on any warning level (greater than 0) it will warn about the recursive nature of the program. What does all this mean in terms of the answers you should expect? It means it's completely meaningless to try and define with certainty what the code snippet posted will do. Calling main results in undefined behavior, and trying to define undefined behavior is obviously a lost cause. The only honest answer anyone can give to ""what happens when I call main ?"" is ""Anything."" I hope this clears things up.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2128321', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/233254/']}",jdg_349682

Question:
While implementing a Kronecker-product for pedagogical reasons (without using the obvious and readily available np.kron() ), I obtained a 4 dimensional array as an intermediate result, which I've to reshape to get the final result. But, I still can't wrap my head around reshaping these high dimensional arrays. I have this 4D array: array([[[[ 0,  0],         [ 0,  0]],        [[ 5, 10],         [15, 20]]],       [[[ 6, 12],         [18, 24]],        [[ 7, 14],         [21, 28]]]]) This is of shape (2, 2, 2, 2) and I'd like to reshape it to (4,4) . One might think that this is obvious to do with np.reshape(my4darr, (4,4)) But, the above reshape does not give me the expected result which is: array([[ 0,  5,  0, 10],       [ 6,  7, 12, 14],       [ 0, 15,  0, 20],       [18, 21, 24, 28]]) As you can see, all the elements in the expected result are present in the 4D array. I just can't get the hang of doing the reshape correctly as needed. In addition to the answer, some explanation of how to do the reshape for such high dimensional arrays would be really helpful.

","General idea for nd to nd transformation The idea with such nd to nd transformation is using just two things - Permute axes (with numpy.transpose or numpy.moveaxis or numpy.rollaxis if the needed permute order is a rolled one or numpy.swapaxes if just two axes need to be swapped) and Reshape. Permute axes : To get the order such that the flattened version corresponds to the flattened version of output. So, if you somehow end up using it twice, look again because you shouldn't. Reshape : To split the axes or bring the final output to the desired shape. Splitting axes is needed mostly at the start, when the input is of lower-dim and we are needed to split into blocks. Again, you shouldn't need this more than twice. Hence, generally we would have three steps : [ Reshape ]      --->  [ Permute axes ]   --->  [ Reshape ] Create more axes             Bring axes             Merge axes                          into correct order Back-tracking method The safest way to solve, given the input and output is through, what one could call as the back-tracking method, i.e. split the axes of the input (when going from smaller nd to bigger nd ) or split the axes of the output (when going from bigger nd to smaller nd ). The idea with the splitting is to bring the number of dims of the smaller nd one same as the bigger nd one. Then, study the strides of the output and match it up against the input to get the required permute order. Finally, a reshape (default way or C order) might be needed at the end, if the final one is a smaller nd one, to merge axes. If both input and output are of same number of dims, then we would need to split both and break into blocks and study their strides against each other. In such cases, we should have the additional input parameter of block sizes, but that's probably off-topic. Example Let's use this specific case to demonstrate how to apply those strategies. In here, the input is 4D , while output is 2D . So, most probably, we won't need reshape to split. So, we need to start with permuting axes. Since, the final output is not 4D , but a 2D one, we would need a reshape at the end. Now, the input here is : In [270]: aOut[270]: array([[[[ 0,  0],         [ 0,  0]],        [[ 5, 10],         [15, 20]]],       [[[ 6, 12],         [18, 24]],        [[ 7, 14],         [21, 28]]]]) The expected output is : In [271]: out    Out[271]:     array([[ 0,  5,  0, 10],           [ 6,  7, 12, 14],           [ 0, 15,  0, 20],           [18, 21, 24, 28]]) Also, this is a bigger nd to smaller nd transformation, so the back-tracking method would involve, splitting the output and studying its strides and matching up against the corresponding values in input : axis = 3                   ---      -->                                                                      axis = 1                                       ------>           axis=2|  axis=0|   [ 0,  5,  0, 10],                       |   [ 6,  7, 12, 14],               v        |            [ 0, 15,  0, 20],      v                   [18, 21, 24, 28]]) Hence, the permuted order needed is (2,0,3,1) : In [275]: a.transpose((2, 0, 3, 1))Out[275]: array([[[[ 0,  5],         [ 0, 10]],        [[ 6,  7],         [12, 14]]],       [[[ 0, 15],         [ 0, 20]],        [[18, 21],         [24, 28]]]]) Then, simply reshape to the expected shape : In [276]: a.transpose((2, 0, 3, 1)).reshape(4,4)Out[276]: array([[ 0,  5,  0, 10],       [ 6,  7, 12, 14],       [ 0, 15,  0, 20],       [18, 21, 24, 28]]) More examples I dug up my history and found few Q&As based on nd to nd transformations. These could serve as other example cases, albeit with lesser explanation (mostly). As mentioned earlier, at most two reshapes and at most one swapaxes / transpose did the job everywhere.

Question:
I was going through C# Brainteasers ( http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/teasers.html ) and came across one question: what should be the output of this code? class Base{    public virtual void Foo(int x)    {        Console.WriteLine (""Base.Foo(int)"");    }}class Derived : Base{    public override void Foo(int x)    {        Console.WriteLine (""Derived.Foo(int)"");    }    public void Foo(object o)    {        Console.WriteLine (""Derived.Foo(object)"");    }}class Test{    static void Main()    {        Derived d = new Derived();        int i = 10;        d.Foo(i);  // it prints (""Derived.Foo(object)""    }} But if I change the code to class Derived {    public void Foo(int x)    {        Console.WriteLine(""Derived.Foo(int)"");    }    public void Foo(object o)    {        Console.WriteLine(""Derived.Foo(object)"");    }}class Program{    static void Main(string[] args)    {        Derived d = new Derived();        int i = 10;        d.Foo(i); // prints  Derived.Foo(int)"");        Console.ReadKey();    }} I want to why the output is getting changed when we are inheriting vs not inheriting; why is method overloading behaving differently in these two cases?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As I specified in the answers page: Derived.Foo(object) is printed - when choosing an overload, if there are any compatible   methods declared in a derived class, all signatures declared in the base class are ignored  - even if they're overridden in the same derived class! In other words, the compiler looks at methods which are freshly-declared in the most derived class (based on the compile-time type of the expression) and sees if any are applicable. If they are, it uses the ""best"" one available. If none is applicable, it tries the base class, and so on. An overridden method doesn't count as being declared in the derived class. See sections 7.4.3 and 7.5.5.1 of the C# 3 spec for more details. Now as for exactly why it's specified like that - I don't know. It makes sense to me that methods declared in the derived class take precedence over those declared in the base class, as otherwise you run into the ""brittle base class"" problem - adding a method in the base class could change the meaning of code using the derived class. However, if the derived class is overriding the method declared in the base class, it's clearly aware of it, so that element of brittleness doesn't apply.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2821620', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/79435/']}",jdg_151168

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Python has these two (among others) builtin objects. They are just objects; in the beginning, they don't have any names yet, but to know what we refer to, let's call them 0x600D and 0xBAD . Before starting to execute a Python (2.x) script, the name True gets bound to the object 0x600D , and the name False gets bound to the object 0xBAD , so when the program refers to True , it looks at 0x600D . Because 0x600D and 0xBAD know that they are usually used by the names True and False , that's what they output when they get printed, i.e. the __str__ method of 0x600D returns 'True' and so on. True = False now binds the name True to a different object. From now on, both names True and False refer to the same object 0xBAD , which, when printed, outputs False . True = True doesn't really do anything: It takes the object referred to by the name True , and binds  the new (and old) name True to this object. Since (because of the previous step) True refers to 0xBAD before this, it still refers to 0xBAD after this. Hence, printing still outputs False . True = not True first takes the object that the name True is bound to, which is 0xBAD . It gives this object to the not operator. not doesn't care (or know) what name is used here to refer to 0xBAD , it just knows that when given 0xBAD it should return 0x600D . This return value is then given to the assignment operator = , binding the name True to this object. Since the name True now once more refers to the object 0x600D , calling print True outputs True , and the world is good again.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2055029', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/14860/']}",jdg_233645

Question:
Let $G$ be a non-abelian group of order $p^3$. How many are itsconjugacy classes? The conjugacy classes are the orbits of $G$ under conjugation of $G$ by itself. Since $G$ is non-abelian, its center has order $p$.So the class equation yields$p^3 = p + \sum_{[x]} (G: G_x)$, where $G_x$ is the centralizer of $x$and the sum is taken over disjoint orbits $[x]$. We can also see that$(G:G_x)$ can only be $p$ or $p^2$. So we will have $p$ orbits of length$1$ and then orbits of length $p$ and $p^2$. Any hints on determining thenumber of the latter?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","We know that $Z(G) = p$. Suppose $[G:G_x] = p^2$ for some $x \notin Z(G)$. Then $G_x$ has $p$ elements, and since $Z(G) \subseteq G_x$, we have $Z(G) = G_x$. Now since $x$ is in $G_x$, it is also in $Z(G)$. From this it follows that $G_x = G$, and thus $Z(G) = G$, a contradiction.

Question:
We all know that $$\ln 2 = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n}.$$ Do you know a series with only rational terms for $$\ln \ln 2 = ?$$ Let's exclude base expansions with non explicit coefficients. Thanks!

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Such a rational series can certainly be written down, though I only consider this answer a partial result since I won't express it as a single sum. From the Taylor series $\ln(1+x)=-\sum_{j=1}^\infty (-x)^j/j$ we may write $\ln\ln(1+x)$ as\begin{align} \ln\ln(1+x)&= \ln\left(x-\sum_{j=2}^\infty\frac{(-x)^j}{j}\right)\\&= \ln x + \ln\left(1+\sum_{j=2}^\infty\frac{(-x)^{j-1}}{j}\right) \\&= \ln x-\sum_{k=1}^\infty\frac{1}{k}\left(-\sum_{j=2}^\infty\frac{(-x)^{j-1}}{j}\right)^k.\end{align}Note that the second term is certainly a rational series in powers of $x$, albeit not one which seems easy to express term-by-term; presumably one could expand using the binomial theorem and resum over $k$. The limit as $x\to 1$ then kills the first term and so yields$$\ln\ln 2 = -\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k}\left(-\sum_{j=2}^\infty\frac{(-1)^{j-1}}{j}\right)^k.$$ Can anyone reduce this further? Note that this amounts to expressing the Taylor series of $\ln(\ln(1+x)/x)$ in a tractable way. Update: After some further work, I remembered that Faa di Bruno's formula expresses the Taylor series of $h(x)=f(g(x))$ in terms of Bell polynomials as $$h^{(n)}(x)=\sum_{k=1}^n f^{(k)}(g(x))\cdot B_{n,k}(g'(x),g''(x),\ldots,g^{(n-k+1)}(x).$$ We can use this to obtain the derivatives at $x=0$ in a rather mechanical way. For our purposes, we take $f(x)=\ln x$ and $g(x)=\ln(1+x)/x$. Then $f^{(k)}(x)=(-1)^{k-1} (k-1)!\,x^{-k}$ and $g^{(k)}(0)=(-1)^k k!/(k+1),$ so \begin{align}\frac{d^n}{dx^n}\left[\ln\left(\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}\right)\right]_{x=0}&=\sum_{k=1}^n f^{(k)}(1)\cdot B_{n,k}\left(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\ldots,(-1)^{n-k+1}\frac{(n-k+1)!}{n-k+2}\right) \\&=\sum_{k=1}^n (k-1)!\,(-1)^{k-1} B_{n,k}\left(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\ldots,(-1)^{n-k+1}\frac{(n-k+1)!}{n-k+2}\right)\end{align}With this, we can express the Taylor series about $x=0$ for the function and take as above the limit as $x\to 1$: \begin{align}\ln\ln 2&=\lim_{x\to 1^-}\ln\left[\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}\right]=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{h^{(n)}(0)}{n!}\\&=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{k-1} \frac{(k-1)!}{n!}\, B_{n,k}\left(-\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{3},\ldots,(-1)^{n-k+1}\frac{(n-k+1)!}{n-k+2}\right).\end{align} This is still a pretty miserable looking expression, but this approach has gotten rid of the powers of $\ln(1+x)/x$ that were present above.

How to get cursor position in libgdx and apply it to sprite? Like this? I want my sprite to have the direction pointed wherever my cursor is in the screen.I search libgdx examples but i cant find any examples related to that.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Get cursor position If you're polling for input, use Gdx.input.getX() and Gdx.input.getY() to get the current mouse x and y coordinates.  (The doc says its only relevant for touch, but the code looks like it reports raw mouse values regardless of button state.) If you're using an InputProcessor you can use one of: touchMoved callback (on older libGDX versions) mouseMoved callback (on newer libGDX versions) to receive input events from a mouse with no buttons pressed. Apply position to sprite Update a Vector2 that points from the current sprite position to the cursor position.  This can be your Sprite's heading.  You'll want to rotate the sprite's heading to match this vector. Use Vector2.angle() to compute the angle of this vector, and set your sprite's rotation to this.

Question:
I was experimenting with anonymous classes today. When I do System.out.println(super.x); , it prints 12, and when I use System.out.println(x); it prints 4. I thought super.x would print 4 and was wondering if someone could please explain to me why this is? public class AnonClass {    private int x = 1;    public AnonClass(int x) {        this.x = x;    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        AnonClass test = new AnonClass(4);        test.testMethod();    }    public void testMethod() {        AnonClass anon = new AnonClass(12) {            {                System.out.println(super.x); //Prints 12                System.out.println(x); //prints 4            }        };    }}

","When you define an anonymous class like this inside class AnonClass : AnonClass anon =    new AnonClass(12) {      {        System.out.println(super.x); //Prints 12        System.out.println(x); //prints 4      }    }; the compiler will create a class something like this: class AnonClass$1 extends AnonClass {  final AnonClass enclosed;  AnonClass$1(AnonClass enclosed, int x) {    super(x);    System.out.println(super.x);    System.out.println(enclosed.x);    this.enclosed = enclosed;  }} and then invoke it like: AnonClass anon = new AnonClass$1(this, 12); Note that the invocation of the superconstructor ( super(x); ) happens before the contents of the instance initializer (the System.out.println lines). As such, the field AnonClass.x is initialized to 12 by the superconstructor, and then its value is printed as 12 via System.out.println(super.x); . Then, System.out.println(x) is actually referencing the x in the enclosing instance of AnonClass , whose value is 4. The reason it doesn't print 12 again is that x is private ; and as it says in JLS Sec 8.2 : Members of a class that are declared private are not inherited by subclasses of that class. So there is no AnonClass$1.x to print; the only identifier in scope called x is AnonClass.x .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/39986057', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/6703342/']}",jdg_100679

For any given integers $m,n\geq1$, let $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]_m$ be the vector space of homogeneous polynomials of degree $m$ in $x_1,\cdots,x_n$ over the field of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. Denote by $\mathbb{N}^n_m$ the following set$$\mathbb{N}^n_m=\{(a_1,\cdots,a_n)\in \mathbb{Z}^n:a_1,\cdots,a_n\geq0,\ a_1+\cdots+a_n=m\}.$$For any $a=(a_1,\cdots,a_n)\in \mathbb{N}^n_m$, denote by $x^a$ the monomial$$x^a=x_1^{a_1}\cdots x_n^{a_n}.$$It is clear that $x^a$ with $a\in \mathbb{N}^n_m$ form a basis of the vector space $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]_m$. Define an inner product $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ on $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]_m$ such that for any $a=(a_1,\cdots,a_n),b=(b_1,\cdots,b_n)\in \mathbb{N}^n_m$,$$\langle x^a,x^b\rangle=\left\{\begin{aligned}&0& a\neq b\\&a_1!\cdots a_n!\ \ & a=b\end{aligned}\right.$$For any $f(x_1,\cdots,x_n),g(x_1,\cdots,x_n)\in \mathbb{R}[x_1,\cdots,x_n]_m$, a general expression of $\langle f,g\rangle$ I can think out is as follow:$$\langle f,g\rangle=\int_0^{\infty}\cdots\int_0^{\infty}\int_0^{2\pi}\cdots\int_0^{2\pi}e^{-(x_1+\cdots+x_n)}f(\frac{x_1}{e^{i\theta_1}},\cdots,\frac{x_n}{e^{i\theta_n}})g(e^{i\theta_1},\cdots,e^{i\theta_n})dx_1\cdots dx_nd\theta_1\cdots d\theta_n.$$Is there any better integral expression of $\langle f,g\rangle$ not using complex integration, or is there any general expression of $\langle f,g\rangle$ not only confined to integral expression?

","It looks like you have rediscovered the Bargmann-Segal space! Take $n = 1$ for simplicity. Define $BS$ to be the set of analytic functions in $L^2(\mathbb{C},\mu)$ where $\mu$ is $\frac{1}{\pi}e^{-|z|^2}$ times Lebesgue measure. Thus the inner product of $f,g \in BS$ is $$\langle f,g\rangle = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\mathbb{C}} f(z)\overline{g(z)} e^{-|z|^2}\, dz$$ and a short computation shows that the norm of $z^n$ is $\sqrt{n!}$. So for $n = 1$, regard your polynomials as complex polynomials with real coefficients, and this single formula for inner product works simultaneously for all values of $m$. The generalization to arbitrary $n$ is straightforward; the formula for inner product doesn't change.

I know there's others questions about this, but they are old and not updated with the browsers current support. And they not cover the Chrome particular problem with this. I want a video (I want to do that with image too, but here I'm using a video) occupying 100% the width of the window, but with the container having a limited, specified height. Maintaining video's aspect-ratio (which is very important). Basically, the object-fit: cover does the job fine here. And in Safari works perfectly, the video upscale/downscale inside his container maintaining aspect-ratio. In Chrome that happens too, but there's no respect for the height of the container. The element surpasses the height of his container and keep growing to the bottom according to the window's width. object-fit: fill woks well in both browsers, but the problem here is obvious, the aspect-ratio is not respected, deforming the video/image/etc. Here's what I have: HTML <video preload autoplay loop poster=""poster.jpg"" id=""bgvid"">    <source src=""image/video.mp4"" type=""video/mp4""></video> CSS #bgvid {  width: 100%;  min-width: 100%;  height: 445px;  max-height: 445px;  background-color: #f0f0f0;  object-fit: cover; /* cover works perfectly on Safari */} My question is, how can I make this work perfectly respecting the container height (or at least min-height or max-height), responsively in all browsers, keeping the element's aspect-ratio?

","If this looks like your water pump, then yes you can: The tilt in the pulley is caused not from a broke shaft, but from a worn bushing which the shaft rides upon. This is just one of the symptoms which shows up when the pump is dying a short miserable death. As the bushing wears out, there is created more and more space (slop) which allows the shaft to lilt more and more. The force the belt creates on the pulley will in and of itself cause the tilt of the shaft.

Question:
I am trying to deserialize some JSON that contains a value that is sometimes an array, and sometimes a single item.  How can I do this with System.Text.Json and JsonSerializer ?  (This question is inspired by this question for Json.NET by Robert McLaws .) I have received the following JSON: [  {    ""email"": ""john.doe@sendgrid.com"",    ""timestamp"": 1337966815,    ""category"": [      ""newuser"",      ""transactional""    ],    ""event"": ""open""  },  {    ""email"": ""jane.doe@sendgrid.com"",    ""timestamp"": 1337966815,    ""category"": ""olduser"",    ""event"": ""open""  }] And I want to deserialize it to a list of the following type: class Item{    public string Email { get; set; }    public int Timestamp { get; set; }    public string Event { get; set; }    public List<string> Category { get; set; }} Using the following code: var options = new JsonSerializerOptions{    PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase,};var list = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<Item>>(json, options); However, when I do I get the following exception: System.Text.Json.JsonException: The JSON value could not be converted to System.String.

How can I deserialize such a property with System.Text.Json ?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As inspired by this answer by Brian Rogers and other answers to How to handle both a single item and an array for the same property using JSON.net , you can create a generic JsonConverter<List<T>> that checks whether the incoming JSON value is an array, and if not, deserializes an item of type T and returns the item wrapped in an appropriate list.  Even better, you can create a JsonConverterFactory that manufactures such a converter for all list types List<T> encountered in your serialization graph. First, define the following converter and converter factory: public class SingleOrArrayConverter<TItem> : SingleOrArrayConverter<List<TItem>, TItem>{    public SingleOrArrayConverter() : this(true) { }    public SingleOrArrayConverter(bool canWrite) : base(canWrite) { }}public class SingleOrArrayConverterFactory : JsonConverterFactory{    public bool CanWrite { get; }    public SingleOrArrayConverterFactory() : this(true) { }    public SingleOrArrayConverterFactory(bool canWrite) => CanWrite = canWrite;    public override bool CanConvert(Type typeToConvert)    {        var itemType = GetItemType(typeToConvert);        if (itemType == null)            return false;        if (itemType != typeof(string) && typeof(IEnumerable).IsAssignableFrom(itemType))            return false;        if (typeToConvert.GetConstructor(Type.EmptyTypes) == null || typeToConvert.IsValueType)            return false;        return true;    }    public override JsonConverter CreateConverter(Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options)    {        var itemType = GetItemType(typeToConvert);        var converterType = typeof(SingleOrArrayConverter<,>).MakeGenericType(typeToConvert, itemType);        return (JsonConverter)Activator.CreateInstance(converterType, new object [] { CanWrite });    }    static Type GetItemType(Type type)    {        // Quick reject for performance        if (type.IsPrimitive || type.IsArray || type == typeof(string))            return null;        while (type != null)        {            if (type.IsGenericType)            {                var genType = type.GetGenericTypeDefinition();                if (genType == typeof(List<>))                    return type.GetGenericArguments()[0];                // Add here other generic collection types as required, e.g. HashSet<> or ObservableCollection<> or etc.            }            type = type.BaseType;        }        return null;    }}public class SingleOrArrayConverter<TCollection, TItem> : JsonConverter<TCollection> where TCollection : class, ICollection<TItem>, new(){    public SingleOrArrayConverter() : this(true) { }    public SingleOrArrayConverter(bool canWrite) => CanWrite = canWrite;    public bool CanWrite { get; }    public override TCollection Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options)    {        switch (reader.TokenType)        {            case JsonTokenType.Null:                return null;            case JsonTokenType.StartArray:                var list = new TCollection();                while (reader.Read())                {                    if (reader.TokenType == JsonTokenType.EndArray)                        break;                    list.Add(JsonSerializer.Deserialize<TItem>(ref reader, options));                }                return list;            default:                return new TCollection { JsonSerializer.Deserialize<TItem>(ref reader, options) };        }    }    public override void Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, TCollection value, JsonSerializerOptions options)    {        if (CanWrite && value.Count == 1)        {            JsonSerializer.Serialize(writer, value.First(), options);        }        else        {            writer.WriteStartArray();            foreach (var item in value)                JsonSerializer.Serialize(writer, item, options);            writer.WriteEndArray();        }    }} Then add the the converter factory to JsonSerializerOptions.Converters before deserialization: var options = new JsonSerializerOptions{    Converters = { new SingleOrArrayConverterFactory() },    PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase,};var list = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<List<Item>>(json, options); Or add a specific converter either to options or to your data model directly using JsonConverterAttribute : class Item{    public string Email { get; set; }    public int Timestamp { get; set; }    public string Event { get; set; }    [JsonConverter(typeof(SingleOrArrayConverter<string>))]    public List<string> Category { get; set; }} If your data model uses some other type of collection, say ObservableCollection<string> , you can apply a lower level converter SingleOrArrayConverter<TCollection, TItem> as follows: [JsonConverter(typeof(SingleOrArrayConverter<ObservableCollection<string>, string>))]    public ObservableCollection<string> Category { get; set; } Notes: If you want the converter(s) to apply only during deserialization, pass canWrite: false to the parameterized constructor: Converters = { new SingleOrArrayConverterFactory(canWrite: false) } The converter will still get used, but will unconditionally generate a default serialization. The converter is not implemented for jagged 2d or nD collections such as List<List<string>> .  It is also not implemented for arrays and read-only collections. According to Serializer support for easier object and collection converters #1562 , because JsonConverter<T> lacks an async Read() method, A limitation of the existing [JsonConverter] model is that it must ""read-ahead"" during deserialization to fully populate the buffer up to the end up the current JSON level. This read-ahead only occurs when the async+stream JsonSerializer deserialize methods are called and only when the current JSON for that converter starts with a StartArray or StartObject token. Thus using this converter to deserialize potentially very large arrays may have a negative performance impact. As discussed in the same thread, the converter API may get redesigned in System.Text.Json - 5.0 to fully support async deserialization by converters for arrays and object, implying that this converter may benefit from being rewritten when .NET 5 (no longer labeled with ""Core"") is eventually released.

","Use StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer, because it is faster than StringBuffer .

Effectively meaning that the code complexity would be the order of the squared of the size of your array! ( 1+2+3+ ... n which is the number of characters copied per iteration).

My plugin configuration is: <plugin>    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>    <artifactId>jaxb2-maven-plugin</artifactId>    <version>1.5</version>    <executions>        <execution>            <id>xjc</id>            <goals>                <goal>xjc</goal>            </goals>        </execution>    </executions>    <configuration>        <packageName>com.x.y.model</packageName>        <wsdl>true</wsdl>    </configuration></plugin> I am testing this with mvn -X clean jaxb2:xjc but the plugin is ignoring the .wsdl as seen in the debug output [DEBUG] accept false for file c:\projects\foo\src\main\xsd\service.wsdl[DEBUG] accept true for file c:\projects\foo\src\main\xsd\datatypes.xsd[DEBUG] accept true for file c:\projects\foo\src\main\xsd\more-datatypes.xsd

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","By examining the Maven debug output of the arguments being passed to the JAXB XJC (and a bit of trial and error) I found that I needed to supply 2 more configuration parameters to the plugin. This stops the plugin scanning for XSD files and just uses the .wsdl as the source. The XSD files are included in the WSDL as <xsd:include schemaLocation=""datatypes.xsd"" /> directives, for example, which are resolved locally resulting in all types from the WSDL and XSD being generated as Java classes. The configuration section that worked for me is: <configuration>    <packageName>com.x.y.model</packageName>    <wsdl>true</wsdl>    <xmlschema>false</xmlschema>    <schemaFiles>service.wsdl</schemaFiles></configuration> Without the <xmlschema>false</xmlschema> Maven errors with: org.apache.maven.lifecycle.LifecycleExecutionException: Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:jaxb2-maven-plugin:1.5:xjc (default-cli) on project foo: Could not process schema:    /c:/projects/foo/src/main/xsd/service.wsdl",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/15903249', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/637889/']}",jdg_295036

Question:
I'm having an issue with replacing a string in java... the line is: subject = subject.replaceAll(""\\[calEvent\\]"", calSubject); This line doesn’t work with $ sign in calSubject. what the subject variable is, a dynamic subject line variable from a file. for example like so:Calnot = [calEvent] what i am trying to do is replace the calEvent place holder with the subject variable. but how i did it does not work because it crashes when the subject contains a $ sign. any idea how I can do this so it won't break if the subject contains a $ sign or any characters for that matter?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","That's because the dollar sign is a special character in a replacement string, use Matcher.quoteReplacement() to escape this kind of character. subject = subject.replaceAll(""\\[calEvent\\]"", Matcher.quoteReplacement(calSubject)); From the doc of String.replaceAll() : Note that backslashes ( \ ) and dollar signs ( $ ) in the replacement  string may cause the results to be different than if it were being  treated as a literal replacement string; see Matcher.replaceAll. Use Matcher.quoteReplacement(java.lang.String) to suppress the special  meaning of these characters, if desired. Note that the dollar sign is used to refer to the corresponding capturing groups in the regular expression ( $0 , $1 , etc.). EDIT Matcher.quoteReplacement() has been introduced in Java 1.5, if you're stuck in Java 1.4 you have to escape $ manually by replacing it with \$ inside the string. But since String.replaceAll() would also take the \ and the $ as special characters you have to escape them once and you also have to escape all \ once more for the Java runtime. (""$"", ""\$"") /* what we want */(""\$"", ""\\\$"") /* RegExp engine escape */(""\\$"", ""\\\\\\$"") /* Java runtime escape */ So we get : calSubject = calSubject.replaceAll(""\\$"", ""\\\\\\$"");",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/16018831', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/460733/']}",jdg_320126

Question:
I'm wondering if anyone knows how to deal with the following quirky template structure: ### base.html<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN""><html lang=""en""><head>  <title> {% block title %} Title of the page {% endblock %} </title></head><body>  <header>    {% block header %}      {% include ""base/header.html"" %}    {% endblock header %}  </header>  {% block content %}{% endblock %}</body></html> ### base/header.html<div id=""menu-bar"">  {% block nav %}    {% include ""base/nav.html"" %}  {% endblock %}</div> ### base/nav.html<nav id=""menu"">  <ul>    <li>      <a href=""/profile/"">My Profile</a>    </li>    <li>      <a href=""/favs/"">My Favorites</a>    </li>    {% block extra-content %}{% endblock %}  </ul></nav> And, the heart of the matter: ### app/somepage.html{% extends ""base.html"" %}{% block content %}  <p>Content is overridden!</p>{% endblock %}{% block extra-content %}  <p>This will not show up, though...</p>{% endblock %}{% block nav %}  <p>Not even this.</p>{% endblock %} The problem is when extending a template you can only override the blocks declared in the parent only, not any of its children. I suppose I could make base.html a husk of empty unused nested blocks covering all future contingencies, but would even that override properly? And is that the only way? If you're wondering why I have a bi-directional include/extends workflow around base.html, I have many sub-templates that I want to get used all across the project: Headers, footers, navs, sidebars, etc. They all will be consistant in structure across the entire site, but in many cases a whole subdivision of the site will only need a few of those sub-templates. My idea was to define the sub-templates under the templates/base folder, and have templates/base-type1.html, templates/base-type2.html, etc to extend in other places. Each type would only reference the sub-templates needed, and override them to place content as needed.

","It seems to be little known that you can use the with keyword with the include to pass variables into the context of an included template - you can use it to specify includes in the included template: # base.html<html>    <body>        {% block header %}{% include ""header.html"" %}{% endblock %}    </body></html># header.html# some stuff here<div id=""header"">    <img src=""logo.png"">    {% include nav_tmpl|default:""navigation.html"" %}</div># special_page.html (uses other navigation){% extends ""base.html"" %}{% block header %}    {% include ""header.html"" with nav_tmpl=""special_nav.html"" %}    # you might also want to wrap the include in an 'if' tag if you don't want anything    # included here per default {% endblock %} This approach saves you at least from having one additional file just for the purpose of overwriting a block.

Question:
I'm making a Genetic Program, but I'm hitting a limitation with C# where I want to present new functions to the algorithm but I can't do it without recompiling the program.  In essence I want the user of the program to provide the allowed functions and the GP will automatically use them. It would be great if the user is required to know as little about programming as possible. I want to plug in the new functions without compiling them into the program.  In Python this is easy, since it's all interpreted, but I have no clue how to do it with C#.  Does anybody know how to achieve this in C#? Are there any libraries, techniques, etc?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It depends on how you want the user of the program to ""provide the allowed functions."" If the user is choosing functions that you've already implemented, you can pass these around as delegates or expression trees. If the user is going to write their own methods in C# or another .NET language, and compile them into an assembly, you can load them using Reflection. If you want the user to be able to type C# source code into your program, you can compile that using CodeDom, then call the resulting assembly using Reflection. If you want to provide a custom expression language for the user, e.g. a simple mathematical language, then (assuming you can parse the language) you can use Reflection.Emit to generate a dynamic assembly and call that using -- you guessed it -- Reflection.  Or you can construct an expression tree from the user code and compile that using LINQ -- depends on how much flexibility you need.  (And if you can afford to wait, expression trees in .NET 4.0 remove many of the limitations that were in 3.5, so you may be able to avoid Reflection.Emit altogether.) If you are happy for the user to enter expressions using Python, Ruby or another DLR language, you can host the Dynamic Language Runtime, which will interpret the user's code for you. Hosting the DLR (and IronPython or IronRuby) could be a good choice here because you get a well tested environment and all the optimisations the DLR provides. Here's a how-to using IronPython. Added in response to your performance question: The DLR is reasonably smart about optimisation.  It doesn't blindly re-interpret the source code every time: once it has transformed the source code (or, specifically, a given function or class) to MSIL, it will keep reusing that compiled representation until the source code changes (e.g. the function is redefined).  So if the user keeps using the same function but over different data sets, then as long as you can keep the same ScriptScope around, you should get decent perf; ditto if your concern is just that you're going to run the same function zillions of times during the genetic algorithm.  Hosting the DLR is pretty easy to do, so it shouldn't be hard to do a proof of concept and measure to see if it's up to your needs.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2458869', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/28760/']}",jdg_148516

Question:
I have been looking at certain collections of cardinals lately and am trying to figure out if they are sets or not. Is it true, that if $P$ is some large cardinal property and there is some $\kappa_{\text{first}}$, for which this property holds, that the collection of cardinals $\mathcal{C} = \{\kappa \mid \kappa \text{ has not } P\}$ is a set?Can I argue that $\kappa_{\text{first}}$ must have greater cardinality than all elements of $\mathcal{C}$ and therefore contains $\mathcal{C}$ as a subset? On the other hand, if I know that a collection of cardinals $\mathcal{D}$ contains cardinals of arbitrarily large cardinality, must $\mathcal{D}$ be a proper class?Is it sufficient to argue that if $\mathcal{D}$ was a set, then $\lambda = \sup{\mathcal{D}}^+$ would be a cardinal not in $\mathcal{D}$, but since $\mathcal{D}$ contains arbitrarily large cardinals, one of them would have cardinality greater than $\lambda$, which already yields a contradiction?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Tl;dr: A class of cardinals is a set iff it has an upper bound . The right-to-left direction follows from Separation applied to that upper bound, while the left-to-right direction is via the Burali-Forti paradox. The answer to your second question is yes - any collection of cardinals without an upper bound is not a set. However, your argument isn't correct - in defining $\lambda$, you're assuming what you're trying to prove (that if $\mathcal{D}$ is a set, then it has a supremum). Instead, show that if there were an unbounded set of cardinals, then the class of ordinals would be a set - which violates the Burali-Forti argument . Meanwhile, the answer to your first question is extremely negative: for instance, the successor of a cardinal with a large cardinal property $P$ tends not to have $P$ (e.g. the successor of an inaccessible is not inaccessible, the successor of a measurable is not measurable . . .). Similarly, most large cardinal properties imply regularity, that is, they fail for any singular cardinal - of which there are unboundedly many. So for any large cardinal property $P$ I'm aware of, ZFC proves that the collection of cardinals which don't have $P$ is unbounded, i.e. is a proper class. The only exceptions I can think of are artificial - e.g. say that $\kappa$ is big if $\kappa$ is greater than an inaccessible. Then assuming there is an inaccessible, the collection of non-big cardinals is a set. But this is a very silly property.

Question:
In order to draw chemical structures I use ChemBioDraw Ultra. As an exercise I've to draw the most stable conformation. I expect a twist-boat like structure (instead of usual chair conformation for substituted dioxanes) Is there a freeware or an easy computer online tool to check if my propose (right side picture) is correct? When I go to >Edit > Get 3D Model the program gives me a small picture with a 3D-Model: By double-clicking this small image it opens ChemBio3DUltra and I can rotate this molecule: @Martin: Is this correct (I've expected a twisted cyclic ring)? @Martin I draw the structure at right with i-Bu and H exchanged in Chemdraw and do >Edit > Get 3D Model The reason why I first thought it should be twist boat like was that one C-O is pointing up and the other pointing down. May be someone knows why people gives this stereoinformation inside the cyclic ring? As I've drawn it as a twist boat I get exactly the same with ChemBioDraw. Is there a way to calculate by how many kcal/mol the first one is more stable then the second one with ChemBioDraw? What's interesting: I searched for a structure in which the twist-boat conformation is the most favorable one and found one: However, when there are two large substituents in the cis-1,4 arrangement on   a cyclohexane ring, neither of which will go easily into an axial position, then   it appears that the twist-boat conformation (Section 12-3A) is most favorable   [ http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25034/13/BPOCchapter12.pdf , page 458] (The A-value of a tert-Butyl is in the range of 5 kcal/mol which is around the value of the energy difference between cyclohexane in twist-boat and chair conformation. I've drawn cis-1,4-di-tert-butyl-cyclohexane with ChemDraw and used >Edit>Get 3D Model and ChemBioDraw gave me the structure which is NOT the energetical most suitable one! Why?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Short answer: yes, the dioxane has a minimum when it's in a twist-boat form. I use Avogadro which offers a ""auto-optimize"" tool. You can grab atoms and throw them around to force rings into different conformations while the force field is minimizing. So here's what I did. File -> Import -> Fetch by chemical name: (2R,4R)-2-isobutyl-4-methyl-1,5-dioxaspiro[5.5]undecane. This grabs the 3D geometry from the NIH Resolver (i.e., PubChem) Auto-Optimize Tool: Force Field MMFF94 Then I started minimizing and looking at the energies. I pulled various atoms around to try to minimize steric clashes and flip rings from chair to boat, etc. For the figures that follow, I've removed the hydrogens for clarity, but they exist as far as the energies and minimization. I just removed them to save the graphic. Chair/Chair: 24 kJ/mol Twist-boat/Chair: 14 kJ/mol So yes, there's a decent stabilization in the twisted form of the twist-boat. You have to get the hydrogens right, or you'll end up with a bunch of eclipsed interactions between the dioxane oxygens and hydrogens on the cyclohexane.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/17173', 'https://chemistry.stackexchange.com', 'https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/users/7201/']}",jdg_361396

Below is a question asked on the forum softwareengineering.stackexchange.com. Provide a good and informational response to it like a helpful human would.

Question:
One of the first things I learned about dates and times in c# (and various other languages) is that a date is stored as a DateTime with the time component set to midnight.  There is no difference between ""Jan 1, 2017"" and ""January 1, 2017 00:00:00.000"".  If you need to display just a date, you can use formatting functions like ToString to remove the time portion. This seems to cause a lot of problems, a few of which I shall list here: DateTime takes up more storage space than needed: 8 bytes instead of the 3 required for a simple date. Use of 00:00:00 for ""no date"" conflates ""a known value of 0"" with ""unknown value."" This seems rather noobish, in the same way a new programmer might confuse a null string with an empty string.  Null and empty are different, and ""no time"" and ""midnight"" are different ideas. You see idioms like this one poppping up, even in relatively simple comparisions: if (startDate >= myDateTime && myDateTime < endDate.AddDays(1)) or if (startDateTime >= myDate && myDate <= endDateTime.Date) instead of a far simpler if (startDate >= myDate && myDate <= endDate) When system components located in different time zones call each other over web services, and the schema for those web services is generated from c# types, a time element can be introduced (so that the resulting date occurs early in the morning), or the date value actually may shift by a day (e.g. the final date is actually the prior day at a time late in the evening).  This can make it painful to transmit values that are agnostic with respect to timezone, e.g. a date of birth, or a credit card expiration date. SQL Server has a Date type that stores only month, day, and year. XSD specifies different data types for Date, Time, and DateTime. Why doesn't c# have such a type? How do you work around it?  For example, can c# properties be attributed so that they will serialize as a Date instead of a DateTime?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","What is a Date? Let's say It's noon at your local region. You'll look at your clock and see something like 22/03/2017 12:00. You could say easily that this is the current date for everyone else in the world, right? Well, not really. Chances are, if you are in London, or say, Russia, or the United States, your clock isn't really correct regarding those places. Your clock is marking the wrong time for the rest of the world, and for some places even the wrong date. When you talk about ""the world"", having a date without a time makes little to no sense once you start considering people outside your timezone. Just think how annoying it is to go to a foreigner website and seeing that, somehow, the user generated content there is coming from the future. That's what happens when you don't take into account timezones! That's where C# DateTime goes in. DateTime isn't the usual simple date you may need for local, just-my-company software. It is a somewhat powerful data structure that had the intent to be able to provide Universal Coordinated Time to any app. The magic part of the DateTime structure is that, with minor fiddling, you can make it display the correct DateTime for every single place in the world. The idea behind DateTime was to provide not a simple Date object, but something you could use to represent dates all over the world, even with different Time Zones. It was made thinking in global applications, and thus it was designed with a bunch of extra functionalities that may not have apparent utility at first glance, but nevertheless can save a lot of time from people developing applications that will have to deal with variable time zones. It is far from perfect, yes, but it does what it was meant for - representing Time in a universal, and somewhat portable, way. So, in a sense, when using C# you are forced to consider times when developing your app, not only dates. And, really, that's a good thing - a DateTime is a reference point in time relative to something , and when you change your point of reference, the value for that DateTime must act accordingly. To be totally fair, I think C# is one of the languages that got this thing right. You can have a Time interval without a date (TimeSpan is there for that), but you can't really have a meaningful date on a global scope without a reference frame and a time attached to it. I didn't like DateTime at all when I first met the language, but after having to develop an App with multiple timezones I understood why this design choice was actually a smart one.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/345019', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/115084/']}",jdg_316991

Question:
I have spent two days trying out the various solutions for Mixed and Pure Autolayout approaches to achieve what was a trivial scrollview setup prior to autolayout, and it's now official - I must be too stupid. I am setting this up mostly in Storyboard (well, it's just the way it is). So here's my plea for help. Viewtree: UIView-UIView-UIView..-UIScrollview...-UIButton...-UIButton...-UIButton The buttons are supposed to scroll horizontally (left to right and vice versa). Can someone please let me know how to set the constraints to achieve this using pure Autolayout??? -- I have tried the mixed approach, like so: UIView- UIView- UIView..-UIScrollview...-UIView (contentview)....-UIButton....-UIButton....-UIButton ...and setting fixed width and height constraints for the contentview and the translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints settings as per Apple's TechNote. The buttons and scrollview are set up using constraints. This gets the scrollview scrolling (yay) but alas, it scrolls too far! As far as I can tell, the scroll width is somehow doubled from what I set the contentview at???!!!??? I tried the pure autolayout approach as well, both with contentview and without. All the views are translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints=NO , except for self.view . The buttons have fixed width/height constraints, and are pinned to all four edges of the scrollview. Nothing scrolls. So I am totally baffled why I can't get it to work correctly. Any help is much appreciated, and if you need any other info, please ask! UPDATED Screenshot with solution - buttonZ constraints: EDIT @ Jamie Forrest So the solution turns out to be the wrong trailing constraint on the last button. Instead of 6441, the value I had set was negative, -6441. The tricky thing is, that when setting the value in storyboard, there are two options in the Pin toolbar: The Current Canvas Value is negative (leading to no scroll), and the option below is positive (activating scroll). This means I'm not stupid but at least half-blind I guess. Although, to my defense, isn't it somewhat disturbing that XCode doesn't show an error for the ""incorrect"" setting? EDITED AGAIN Now this is funny... changing the trailing value from -6441 (no scroll) to 6441 enabled scroll. But my old friend the ""too much contentsize"" was back, leading to a content size twice as large as what it should be! The solution to get the correct content scroll was to set the trailing constraint to ZERO! This is not obvious when working in Storyboard but looking at @Infinity James' code, it is what it should be.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It's hard to see the exact values and setup of your constraints as you've pasted them here, so I'm not sure from looking at your screenshots where you have gone wrong. In lieu of an explanation of what's wrong in your setup, I've created a basic sample project with a very similar view hierarchy and constraint setup to the one you describe. The horizontal scrolling works as expected in the sample project, which uses the ""Pure AutoLayout"" approach that Apple describes in the Technical Note . I also had a lot of trouble originally getting Auto Layout to work with UIScrollView . The key to getting it to work is making sure that all of the items in the scroll view, taken together, have constraints that eventually link to all sides of the scroll view and that contribute to the AutoLayout system being able to determine a contentSize for the scroll view that will be bigger than its frame.

Question:
How exactly can you add Margin in Jetpack Compose ? I can see that there is a Modifier for padding with Modifier.padding(...) but I can't seem to find one for margins or am I blind? Someone guide me please. Thank you very much.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You can consider padding and margin as the same thing (imagine it as ""spacing""). A padding can be applied twice (or more) in the same composable and achieve the similar behavior you would get with margin+padding. For example: val shape = CircleShapeText(    text = ""Text 1"",    style = TextStyle(        color = Color.White,        fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold,        textAlign = TextAlign.Center),    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()        .padding(16.dp)        .border(2.dp, MaterialTheme.colors.secondary, shape)        .background(MaterialTheme.colors.primary, shape)        .padding(16.dp)) Will result on this: As you can see, the first padding is adding a space between the component and its border. Then the background and border are defined. Finally, a new padding is set to add space between the border and the text.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/62939473', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/9291997/']}",jdg_360651

Question:
I seem to have a problem in figuring out how to increase or decrease the fontsize of both the x and y tick labels while using matplotlib . I am aware that there is the set_xticklabels(labels, fontdict=None, minor=False, **kwargs) function, but I failed to understand how to control the fontsize in it. I expected something somehow explicit, like title_string=('My Title')plt.suptitle(title_string, y=1.0, fontsize=17) but I haven't found anything like that so far. What am I missing?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You can set the fontsize directly in the call to set_xticklabels and set_yticklabels (as noted in previous answers). This will only affect one Axes at a time. ax.set_xticklabels(x_ticks, rotation=0, fontsize=8)ax.set_yticklabels(y_ticks, rotation=0, fontsize=8) Note this method should only be used if you are fixing the positions of the ticks first (e.g. using ax.set_xticks ). If you are not changing the tick positions from the default ones, you can just change the font size of the tick labels without changing the text using ax.tick_params ax.tick_params(axis='x', labelsize=8)ax.tick_params(axis='y', labelsize=8) or ax.tick_params(axis='both', labelsize=8) You can also set the ticklabel font size globally (i.e. for all figures/subplots in a script) using rcParams : import matplotlib.pyplot as pltplt.rc('xtick',labelsize=8)plt.rc('ytick',labelsize=8) Or, equivalently: plt.rcParams['xtick.labelsize']=8plt.rcParams['ytick.labelsize']=8 Finally, if this is a setting that you would like to be set for all your matplotlib plots, you could also set these two rcParams in your matplotlibrc file: xtick.labelsize      : 8 # fontsize of the x tick labelsytick.labelsize      : 8 # fontsize of the y tick labels",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/34001751', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/5110870/']}",jdg_274453

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I figured I would make an answer out the comments to the first answer addressing a point which confused me when I first learned this stuff. A morphism $f:X\to Y$ (I have to write it in this direction or else I'll confuse myself) is said to be a closed immersion if $f$ induces a homeomorphism of $X$ onto a closed subset of $Y$ , and $f^\sharp:\mathscr{O}_Y\to f_*(\mathscr{O}_X)$ is surjective. In some references I've seen it is casually remarked that the second condition is equivalent to surjectivity of the map $f_x^\sharp:\mathscr{O}_{Y,f(x)}\to\mathscr{O}_{X,x}$ for all $x\in X$ . But is this really trivial? No! This map, which might reasonably be called the stalk of the morphism $f$ at $x$ , is not literally the same as the stalk of $f^\sharp$ at $f(x)$ . Indeed, that is a map $f_{f(x)}^\sharp:\mathscr{O}_{Y,f(x)}\to(f_*\mathscr{O}_X)_{f(x)}$ . In general, there is always a natural map $\varphi_x:(f_*\mathscr{O}_X)_{f(x)}\to\mathscr{O}_{X,x}$ , but it isn't in general an isomorphism. The map $f_x^\sharp$ is equal to $\varphi_x\circ f_{f(x)}^\sharp$ . So while it is standard that the map $f^\sharp$ of sheaves (on $Y$ !) is surjective if and only if $f_y^\sharp:\mathscr{O}_{Y,y}\to (f_*\mathscr{O}_X)_y$ is surjective for all $y\in Y$ , this does not obviously say anything about surjectivity of the maps $f_x^\sharp:\mathscr{O}_{Y,f(x)}\to\mathscr{O}_{X,x}$ for $x\in X$ . If however $f$ is a homeomorphism onto a closed subset $f(X)\subseteq Y$ , then the stalks of $f_*\mathscr{O}_X$ at points of $Y$ are easy to compute: they are zero at points outside of $f(X)$ , and at a point $f(x)\in f(X)$ , we have that the natural map $(f_*\mathscr{O}_X)_{f(x)}\to\mathscr{O}_{X,x}$ is an isomorphism. So in that case, surjectivity of each $f_x^\sharp$ , $x\in X$ , actually will imply surjectivity of $f_y^\sharp$ , $y\in Y$ , and hence of $f^\sharp$ . Without the condition that $f$ is a closed topological immersion on the underlying topological spaces, it is not going to be true that $f^\sharp$ is surjective if and only if $f_x^\sharp$ is surjective for all $x\in X$ . To make this clearer, let's assume $X=\mathrm{Spec}(B)$ and $Y=\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ , so $f=\mathrm{Spec}(\alpha)$ for $\alpha:A\to B$ a ring homomorphism. The stalk map of $f$ at $x=\mathfrak{q}\in\mathrm{Spec}(B)$ is the ring map $A_\mathfrak{p}\to B_\mathfrak{q}$ , where $\mathfrak{q}=\alpha^{-1}(\mathfrak{p})$ . In general, surjectivity of this map for all $\mathfrak{q}\in\mathrm{Spec}(B)$ does not imply surjectivity of $\alpha$ itself. I think the simplest example that will illustrate this is when $B=A_g$ is a principal localization of $A$ . Then in fact the stalk map in the previous paragraph is an isomorphism for every prime ideal of $A_g$ (the set of which are in natural bijection with the set of primes of $A$ not containing $g$ , i.e. $D(g)$ ). But the localization map $A\to A_g$ (i.e. the map on global sections of $f$ ) is not usually surjective. Note that in this case $f$ is a homeomorphism onto the open subset $D(g)$ of $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ , but $D(g)$ is not generally closed in $A$ . I think maybe this illustrates why the first condition is important, and why, if one wants to think about surjectivity of $f^\sharp$ in terms of the stalks of $f$ , $f_x^\sharp$ , for $x\in X$ , the topological condition is needed, and logically “precedes” the condition on $f^\sharp$ . Lastly, I should note that the maps which I have been calling the “stalks of $f$ ,” $f_x^\sharp$ , for $x\in X$ , are in fact the stalks of the map of sheaves on $X$ (in the usual sense) $f^\flat:f^{-1}\mathscr{O}_Y\to \mathscr{O}_X$ corresponding to $f^\sharp$ under the adjunction between $f^{-1}$ and $f_*$ . So surjectivity of all $f_x^\sharp$ , $x\in X$ , is logically equivalent to surjectivity of $f^\flat$ . There is no reason to believe that $f^\flat$ is surjective if and only if $f^\sharp$ is, or even that there is an implication in either direction in general.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/712336', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/35358/']}",jdg_357023

Question:
Just what the title says. An LED series should probably go dead after an LED goes OC. There are strings out there in the market where the series continues to function even though one, or more LED dies. I'm guessing the series is not a real series but something more complex... How would I achieve something like this? I'm guessing perhaps the series provides multiple paths somehow..

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","LEDs that fail catastrophically usually fail open circuit but some occasionally fail short circuit. Large groups of LEDs are often arranged as say X strings of Y LEDs in series in each string. If no attempt is mde to do otherwise, open-circuit failure of a single LED will result in all Y LEDs in the string going out. If X strings of Y LEDs are connected in parallel and the whole array is fed with constant current, if one string goes OC then the current wu=ill be shared by the remaining Y-1 strings and current will rise by a factor of Y/(Y-1) eg if there are 3 strings in parallel then o/c failure of one string will increase the current in the other two strings by 50% each. Whether this matters depends on the LEDs and how close they were being run to their rated value. Modern White (and certain other) LEDS have a very low margin of Imaxmax and Imaxoperating. This may be 1.2:1 or 1.3:1 . Simple circuits can be provided which maintain  the string currents if one string fails BUT the safest measure is one current source per series string. This requires as little as eg an LM317 and a sense resistor (see text and diagram below). LM317s can be had for about 50 cents /1 and 8 cents in 10,000 quantities at Digikey. The excessively keen can wire a component across an LED such that if the LED goes OC the shunting circuit carries its current. eg for White LDS with a Vf operating of say 3.3V then connecting a 3V9 zener across each LED will allow O/C LEDS to be allowed for. As below. This would usually only be done dor upmarket systems. A transistor and resistor divider circuit can perform the same function. In any serious product with LEDs providing illumination and not just acting as ""indicators"" the LEDs MUST be driven with constant current to achieve consistent brightness and good lifetimes. A constant current circuit can be very very simple and quite cheap. In the circuit below Iled = V/R = 1.25/R or R = Vled/Iled. For 3R9 as shown Iled = V/R = 1.25/3.9 = 320 mA. One LED is shown but as many as desired can be placed in series and will share the same current. The limiting value is that Vin must supply Vleds + 1.25V drop across Rcurrent_set + regulator dropout voltage (about 2.5V.) So eg for 5 x 3.3V LEDS Vin needs to be >= Vl + Vrc + Vdo = 5 x 3.3 + 1.25 + 2.5 = 20.25 V minimum. .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/21349', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/5156/']}",jdg_130165

Question:
Let $G_1$ and $G_2$ be topological groups.  Assume that there exists a continuous homomorphism $f : G_1 \rightarrow G_2$ which (ignoring the group structure) is a homotopy equivalence.  If $BG_i$ is a classifying space for $G_i$, then we get an induced map $f_{\ast} : BG_1 \rightarrow BG_2$ which is a homotopy equivalence. The fact that $f_{\ast}$ is a homotopy equivalence is clear if you construct $BG_i$ via Milnor's construction of classifying spaces.  However, the existence of $BG_i$ is also an easy consequence of the (unpointed) Brown representability theorem.  This leads me to my question : is there an ""abstract nonsense"" proof that $f_{\ast}$ is a homotopy equivalence which avoids having to know an explicit description of $BG_i$? EDIT : As Fernando Muro pointed out, the desired result is equivalent to the fact that if $EG \rightarrow BG$ is the universal $G$-bundle over $BG$, then the space $EG$ is contractible.  Of course, this is true, but I don't see how to prove it without knowing an explicit construction of $BG$.  My definition of $BG$ and the universal bundle $EG \rightarrow BG$ is that $BG$ is a space such that for any CW complex $X$, the set of principal $G$-bundles on $X$ is naturally in bijection with $[X,BG]$ via the map that takes $\phi : X \rightarrow BG$ to $\phi^{\ast}(EG)$.  Is there a way to see that $EG$ has to be contractible without knowing a construction of $BG$?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The space $\Omega BG$ is, by categorical nonsense, a classifying space for principal $G$-bundles over $\Sigma X$ with a chosen trivialisation at the basepoint.  Any such bundle can be trivialised over the upper and lower halves of $\Sigma X$, and the difference between the two trivialisations gives a map $X\to G$.  One can show using this that $G$ represents the same functor as $\Omega BG$, so they are homotopy equivalent.  (We probably want to assume here that $G$ has the homotopy type of a CW complex).  In fact, this line of argument gives a map $G\to\Omega BG$ that is well-defined and natural up to homotopy. This should be enough to show that $\Omega(f_*)$ is a homotopy equivalence, and thus that $\pi_*(f_*)$ is an isomorphism, so $f_*$ is a weak equivalence.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/75612', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/17855/']}",jdg_276317

Question:
This question could equally apply to the computation of other symbolic transformations of a function, but I use the Hessian as an example here. Consider a two-variable function fun which could be defined either using down-values or as a Function .  It may or may not contain symbolic parameters. Compute the Hessian of fun and return it as a Function .  The symbolic computation must already be done and the result embedded in the result function.  This function will be used for multiple numerical evaluations later. One possible way to do this is: hessian[fun_] :=   Block[{hess, x, y},     Function[{x, y}, hess] /. hess -> D[fun[x, y], {{x, y}, 2}]  ] What's wrong with this?  Consider cases when fun may contain parameters (which in my case will usually be global variables with their value already set).  What if these conflict with the Block variables? x = 5;hessian[Function[{a, b}, x a^3 + b^3]](* Function[{x, y}, {{12 x^2, 0}, {0, 6 y}}] *)p = 5;hessian[Function[{a, b}, p a^3 + b^3]](* Function[{x, y}, {{30 x, 0}, {0, 6 y}}] *) One workaround is to make these live in a context that is not user-accessible, e.g. hessian[fun_] :=  Block[{hessian`hess, hessian`x, hessian`y},   Function[{hessian`x, hessian`y}, hessian`hess] /.    hessian`hess ->     D[fun[hessian`x, hessian`y], {{hessian`x, hessian`y}, 2}]] But this is getting ugly quickly.

Question:
This is a corollary to my other meta question about the serial voting reversal script. At what threshold and at what recency it is worth to flag serial upvoting that I find on other users' accounts? For instance I found this: Now this is obviously serial voting, and the automated script caught only 75 of the 200+ points the user obtained this way. The problem is, it happened over 2 years ago. So this got me thinking. There are literally thousands of cases like this, where conventional wisdom of ""flag it if you see it"" would mean I'd have to pester the moderation team with days worth of work sifting through these. We'd be talking a month or more of 100 flags a day to go through the backlog of just the last 3 years. Is it worth for me to report 6-8 serial votes that happened years ago?  Sometimes people go ""mild"" on serial voting and don't go upvoting 20+ posts at once, but only 6 or 7 at once. I understand mods have to escalate all of these flags, and CMs have to manually review each case, so I'm hesitant to flag in mass. I don't want to cost the community team and moderators more than the entire endeavour is worth. So my question is: Is there any official guidance about when serial voting matters enough to be worth reporting? Ideally looking for community discussion and maybe an official answer on the topic.

","I ran your script on internal data with the default options and compared the results to those of the second system mentioned here . Your script identified two users who were missed by the internal tool. This suggests that there's no particular urgency: if and when we want to clean up these votes, we likely already have sufficient data on 99% of them without needing flags. What's lacking is the time to weed out false-positives. As Brad mentioned, we do this by hand right now; moderators review flags, review the users identified, and either act or escalate; if they escalate, then at least one person on the team (possibly multiple) review the votes before finally invalidating. We do this because we tend to consider it a lot more important to avoid driving away people by carelessly invalidating votes than to reduce small-scale fraud. Of course...ideally we'd accomplish both goals. Over the past year, you've tried a few different approaches to finding these: as a result, your success rate has gotten a lot better. You're not the first person to use the basic approach exhibited in your latest script, but the thresholds you've chosen appear to avoid a lot of the false-positives normally seen (and which make these so tedious to handle). So to answer your question...focus on recent events. Catching them stands to do a lot more good, but more importantly, they're much more effective at letting you hone your tools, and helping us hone ours.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/355977', 'https://meta.stackoverflow.com', 'https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/5389107/']}",jdg_135802

","Breaking it down, there are three big pieces: :()      # Defines a function, "":"".

Inside the body, the function is invoked twice and the pipeline is backgrounded; each successive invocation on the processes spawns even more calls to "":"".

Question:
I'm reading this specification which is an agreement between web servers and search engine crawlers that allows for dynamically created content to be visible to crawlers.It's stated there that in order for a crawler to index html5 application one must implement routing using #! in URLs. In angular html5mode(true) we get rid of this hashed part of the URL. I'm wondering whether this is going to prevent crawlers from indexing my website.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Short answer - No, html5mode will not mess up your indexing, but read on. Important note: Both Google and Bing can crawl AJAX based content without HTML snapshots I know, the documentation you link to says otherwise but about a year or two ago they officially announced that they handle AJAX content without the need for HTML snapshots, as long as you use pushstates, but a lot of the documentation is old and unfortunately not updated. SEO using pushstates The requirement for AJAX crawling to work out of the box is that you are changing your url using pushstates. This is just what html5mode in Angular does (and also what a lot of other frameworks do). When pushstates is on the crawlers will wait for ajax calls to finish and for javascript to update the page before they index it. You can even update things like page-title or even meta tags in your router and it will index properly. In essence you don't need to do anything, there is no difference between server-side and client-side rendered sites in this case. To be clear, a lot of SEO-analysis tools (such as Moz) will spit out warnings on pages using pushstates. That's because those tools (and their reps if you talk to them) are at the time of writing not up to date, so ignore them. Finally, make sure you are not using the fragment meta-tag from below when doing this. If you have that tag the crawlers will think that you want to use the non-pushstates method and things might get messed up. SEO without pushstates There is very little reason not to use pushstates with Angular, but if you don't you need to follow the guidelines linked to in the question. In short you create snapshots of the html on your server and then you use the fragment meta tag to change your url-fragment to be ""#!"" instead of ""#"". <meta name=""fragment"" content=""!"" /> When a crawler finds a page like this it will remove the fragment part of the url and instead requests the url with the parameter _escaped_fragment_, and you can serve your snapshotted page in response. Giving the crawler a normal static page to index. Note that the fragment meta-tag should only be used if you want to trigger this behaviour. If you are using pushstates and want the page to index that way, don't use this tag. Also, when using snapshots in Angular you can have html5mode on. In html5mode the fragment is hidden but it is still technically exists and will still trigger the same behaviour, assuming the fragment meta-tag is set. A warning - Facebook crawler While both Google and Bing will crawl your AJAX pages without problem (if you are using pushstates), Facebook will not. Facebook does not understand ajax-content and still requires special solutions, like html snapshots served specifically to the facebook bot (user agent facebookexternalhit/1.1). Edit - I should probably mention that I have deployed sites with all of these versions. Both with html5mode, fragment meta tag and snapshots and without any snapshots and just relying on the pushstate-crawling. It all works fine, except for pushstates and Facebook as noted above.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/31437815', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2545680/']}",jdg_354291

How do you divide two integers and get a double or float answer in C?

","You need to cast one or the other to a float or double . int x = 1;int y = 3;// Beforex / y; // (0!)// After((double)x) / y; // (0.33333...)x / ((double)y); // (0.33333...)

Regarding @Chad's comment ("" [tailsPerField setIntValue:tailsPer] ""): Don't pass a double or float to setIntValue when you have setDoubleValue , etc. available.  That's probably the same issue as I mentioned in the comment, where you aren't using an explicit cast, and you're getting an invalid value because a double is being read as an int.

","It can be done with the help of the $\color{blue}{Casorati-Weierstrass\ theorem}$ or by the $\color{blue} {Liouville's\ theorem, }$ With the help of $\color{blue}{Casorati-Weierstrass\ theorem}$ Suppose $f$ is an entire function whose image is not dense in $\mathbb{C}$. Then there exists a complex number $\alpha$ and a number $s> 0$  such that |$f(z)-\alpha|>s$ $\forall  z \in \mathbb{C}$. Write $f(z) =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a_nz^n$ and suppose that there are infinitely many nonzero terms in this expansion.

Herstein's Definition: In the Euclidean ring $R$, a nonunit $\pi$ is said to be a prime element of $R$ if whenever $\pi=ab$, where $a,b \in R$, then one of $a$ or $b$ is a unit in R. $\mathbb Q$ is a field and hence a Euclidean ring. In $\mathbb Q$ every element except $0$ is a unit. So there are no prime elements in $\mathbb Q$?

","Actually yes, There is no prime elements in $\mathbb Q$. Every element in $\mathbb Q$ is divisible by another element in $\mathbb Q$ Think about any element in $\mathbb Q$. For example, $3 \in \mathbb Q$ is not prime because we have that $\frac{1}{3} \times {9} = 3$ In general, an element $\alpha \in \mathbb Q$ is in the form of $\frac{a}{b}$ where $a,b$ are both integers and $b \neq 0$.

However, sometimes irreducibility implies prime and in a euclidean domain, it's true because a euclidean domain is also a unique factorization domain. However, In a general integral domain, Irreducible doesn't imply prime. The definition for a prime element is the following. $p$ is said to be a prime element , if $p$ is a positive non unit element and if $p \mid ab$ then $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$ Now to give you an example where there is an irreducible element which is not prime.

Question:
Let $f:\mathbb R\to \mathbb R,$ and suppose $f$ is differentiable at every point of a measurable $E\subset \mathbb R,$ with $f'>0$ on $E$ . Suppose also that $m(E)>0$ (where $m$ is Lebesgue measure). Prove that $m(f(E))>0$ . My proof: Since $f$ is differentiable then it's continuous and hence it preserves both compact sets and intervals. Now since $m(E)>0$ we can find compact interval inside it (is this true or not?)If this is true so the proof is completed. I know that if $E$ is measurable then $E$ is either Borel set or a set of measure zero. So here $E$ is Borel, but still not necessarily to be an interval.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I will prove two points : first, in response to a comment of zhw, we check that $f(E)$ is measurable, and then that its measure is $>0$ . We recall that $m^*$ denotes here Lebesgue outer measure, defined for every subset $S \subset \mathbb{R}$ . For $I$ an open interval of $\mathbb{R}$ , we note $l(I) = \sup I - \inf I$ . Then we define $$m^*(S) = \inf \left \{ \sum \limits_{k=1}^{+\infty} l(I_k),\ (I_k)_{k \ge 1} \textrm{ is a sequence of intervals with } S \subset \bigcup \limits_{k \in \mathbb{N}^*} I_k \right \}$$ For both results, the following lemma will be needed. Lemma : Given $f : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ differentiable at any point of a set $S$ , assuming that there exists $C \ge 0$ such that $\forall x \in S,\ |f'(x)| \le C$ , then $m^* \big( f(S) \big) \le C \cdot m^*(S)$ . Proof : Let $\varepsilon > 0$ . We define an increasing sequence of sets $(S_n)_{n \ge 1}$ by : $$S_n = \left \{ x \in S,\ \forall t \in S,\ |t-x| \le \frac{1}{n} \Rightarrow |f(t)-f(x)| \le (C+\varepsilon)|t-x| \right \}$$ Using the hypothesis $|f'|\le C$ , we get that $S = \bigcup \limits_{n=1}^{\infty} S_n$ . For every $n \ge 1$ , we can take a sequence of open intervals $(I_{n,k})_{k \ge 1}$ covering $S_n$ and such that $\sum \limits_{k=1}^{+\infty} m^*(I_{n,k}) \le m^*(S_n)+\varepsilon.$ Without loss of generality, we can assume that for every $n$ and $k$ , $m^*(I_{n,k}) \le \frac{1}{n}$ . Then, for $n \in \mathbb{N}^*$ , for all $k \in \mathbb{N}^*$ , for $x,y \in S_n \cap I_{n,k}$ , we have $|y-x|\le \frac{1}{n}$ and $x,y \in S_n$ , so we can write $|f(y)-f(x)| \le (C+\varepsilon)|y-x|\le (C+\varepsilon)\cdot m^*(I_{n,k})$ .Thus, for $n \ge 1$ , $$m^*(f(S_n)) \le \sum \limits_{k=1}^{+\infty} m^*\big(f(S_n \cap I_{n,k}) \big) \le \sum \limits_{k=1}^{+\infty} (C+\varepsilon)\cdot m^*(I_{n,k}) \le (C+\varepsilon)\cdot (m^*(S_n)+\varepsilon)$$ Letting $n \to +\infty$ and then $\varepsilon \to 0^+$ , we get $m^* \big( f(S) \big) \le C \cdot m^* (S)$ . Now we prove that $f(E)$ is measurable. Classically (see Problem about $G_{\delta}$ and $F_{\delta}$ sets ), Claim 1 : There exists a subset $H \subset E$ which is $F_{\delta}$ (i.e. a countable union of closed sets) such that $N=E \backslash H$ is a null set. Write $H = \bigcup \limits_{k=1}^{+\infty} F_k$ where the $F_k$ are closed. For $k \ge 1$ , for all $M>0$ , $[-M,M] \cap F_k$ is compact and $f$ is continuous (because it is differentiable) on this set, so $f([-M,M]\cap F_k)$ is closed (it is a compact set).So for all $k$ , $f(F_k) = \bigcup \limits_{M \in \mathbb{N}^*} f\big([-M,M]\cap F_k\big)$ is a Borel set, so $f(H)$ is measurable. Now we prove that $f(N)$ is a null set. For $k \in \mathbb{N}^*$ , we denote $N_k = \{ x \in N,\ f'(x)<k \}$ . $N_k \subset N$ so $N_k$ is a null set, so $m^*(N_k)=0$ for $k \ge 1$ . Plus, we can use the previous lemma on $N_k$ , because $0 \le f' \le k$ on $N_k$ , so $m^* \big(f(N_k) \big)\le 0$ .Thus $f(N_k)$ is a null set. As $f(E) = f(H) \cup f(N)$ , we can conclude that $$f(E) \textrm{ is measurable}.$$ Now back to the original problem : we have some measurable set $E$ with positive measure, $f$ differentiable on $E$ , $f'>0$ on E. We suppose that $m \big( f(E) \big)=0$ . For $x \in E$ , $f'(x)>0$ so $\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}>0$ for all $y \in E \backslash \{x \}$ in some neighborhood of $x$ . Thus \begin{align*}E & = \bigcup \limits_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} \left \{ x \in E\ | \ \ x > q \ \textrm{ and }\ \forall y \in ]q,x[,\ \frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}>0 \right \}\\ & = \bigcup \limits_{q \in \mathbb{Q}} \left \{ x \in E\ | \ \ x > q \ \textrm{ and }\ \forall y \in ]q,x[,\ f(x)>f(y) \right \}\end{align*} because $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense. Moreover, $E$ has positive measure and $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable. Hence, there exists $q_0 \in \mathbb{Q}$ such that $B = \left \{ x \in E\ | \ \ x > q_0 \ \textrm{ and }\ \forall y \in ]q_0,x[,\ f(x)>f(y) \right \}$ has positive measure. Plus, for $(x,y) \in B^2$ with $x<y$ , we have $q_0 < x <y$ , so $f(y)>f(x)$ . Hence $f_{|B}$ is increasing. Finally it is a well-known fact (see Can we have an uncountable number of isolated points ) that $B$ has countably many isolated points, and thus we have a measurable subset $A \subset B$ such that $m(A)=m(B)>0$ and $A$ has no isolated points. Note that we also have $f_{|A}$ increasing, $f'>0$ on A, and $m \big( f(A) \big)=0$ . Now we just need a stronger version of our lemma : Lemma (bis) : Given $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ with no isolated points, and $f : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ , we say that $f$ is differentiable at $x \in A$ whenever $\lim \limits_{t \to x^{\neq}} \frac{f(x)-f(t)}{x-t}$ exists, and we note $f'(x)$ the limit. Assuming that $f$ is differentiable over $A$ , and that there exists $C \ge 0$ such that $|f'| \le C$ , we have $$m^* \big( f(A) \big) \le C \cdot m^*(A)$$ Proof : the proof is exactly the same as the one we gave for the first lemma. Finally, we denote $g = f_{|A}$ . As $g$ is stricly increasing, $g^{-1}$ is well defined. Moreover, as $f'>0$ on $A$ , it is classical (see Inverse functions and differentiation ) to show that $g^{-1}$ is differentiable in the sense of the Lemma bis on $g(A)$ . As $g(A)$ is a null set, we can use our lemma (as we did with the set $N$ - see above) to conclude that $g^{-1}\big( g(A) \big)$ is a null set, so $A$ is a null set, which is absurd. $$\textrm{Hence we have }\ m \big (f(E) \big) > 0.$$",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2087653', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/283366/']}",jdg_323827

Question:
I am new to Angular2 and I'm enjoying it so far but there is one problem: Typings . I can't figure out how to use them and what exactly they are. Some places say to use typings, others say to use npm to install definitions. I'm confused!!

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","JavaScript is untyped, meaning that we can pass around and use data, objects and functions with no constraints. We can write code that calls methods that don't exist on an object, or reference variables that we don't have. These kinds of mistakes can be hard to discover when you are writing code, and it can lead to unstable and buggy code. Doing big changes of your code can become difficult and risky as you don't immediately see if some changes conflicts with the rest of the code somewhere else. TypeScript is mainly about adding types to JavaScript. That means that TypeScript requires you to accurately describe the format of your objects and your data. When you do that, that means that the compiler can investigate your code and discover errors. It can see that you are trying to call a function with the wrong kinds of arguments, or reference a variable that is not accessible in the current scope. When you write TypeScript yourself, this formal description of the code is part of the code itself. However, when you use external libraries like jQuery or moment.js, there are no information of the types in that code. So in order to use it with TypeScript, you also have to get files that describe the types of that code. These are the type declaration files , most often with the file extension name .d.ts . Fortunately people have written those kinds of type declaration files for most common javascript libraries out there. Typings was just a tool to install those files. It is now best practice to just use npm . When you have installed those files, which basically only means downloading them and placing them in your project, the TypeScript compiler will understand* that external code and you will be able to use those libraries. Otherwise you would only get errors everywhere. * Depending on how you have set up your project and configured it, you might have to configure typescript to look for those files specifically, or it might just work without any configuration from your part.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/41573822', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4445446/']}",jdg_118094

","The inet address is your IP address. It is not one of the 3 private ip address ranges so it is a external IP that can be accessed for the outside.

Since your IP is not in any of those ranges it is a public ip and can be accessed through the internet as long as the firewall in front of it is not explicitly blocking packets. The Bcast address is the broadcast address  of your subnet (the network that you are on), this IP is not assigned to to you alone and is the same for everyone on your subnet.

Question:
I have a service that should be able to read and write cookies. To do that in a Symfony-like manner, the service must have access to the request and the response.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I think you really have a couple of options - it really depends on what you are trying to store in a cookie and at what point in the process you need to read do the work. I suggest your first option is to create a service, that has access the the request and creates a response, which it returns ... Define your service in services.yml : services:    a_service:        class:     Acme\DemoBundle\RequestServiceClass        arguments: [@request]        scope: request Your class : //Acme\DemoBundle\RequestServiceClass.phpclass RequestServiceClass{    private $request;    public function __construct(Request $request){         $this->request= $request;   }    public function doSomething(){        // get cookie        $value = $this->request->cookies->get('cookie');        // create cookie        $cookie = new Cookie('cookie', 'value', time() + 3600 * 24 * 7);        // create response        $response = new Response();        // set cookie in response        $response->headers->setCookie($cookie);        return $response;    }} Then to use your service you do something like this public myAction(){    $response = $this->get('a_service')->doSomething();    return $response;} The other way of doing it, is to create a kernel.response listener ... its done like this : Add a service to services.yml : services:  a_listener:    class: Acme\DemoBundle\MyListener    tags:      - { name: kernel.event_listener, event: kernel.response, method: onKernelResponse } Your listener class looks like this : // Acme\DemoBundle\MyListener.phpclass MyListener{    public function onKernelResponse(FilterResponseEvent $event)    {        $response = $event->getResponse();        $request  = $event->getRequest();        // get cookie        $value = $request->cookies->get('cookie');        // create cookie        $cookie = new Cookie('cookie', 'value', time() + 3600 * 24 * 7);        // set cookie in response        $response->headers->setCookie($cookie);    }} The difference between the 2 methods is what information is available at the time of process - for example the service has access to everything you pass it ... the response listener has access to everything in the request and the response - you could check if the response is as expected (ie format or content) and then set a cookie according to that.

Again, based on the accepted answer in the link I posted above: ""A virtual function, is basically saying look, here's the functionality  that may or may not be good enough for the child class. So if it is  good enough, use this method, if not, then override me, and provide  your own functionality."" and that the second level child will inherit the virtual method from its parent, thus satisfying the implementation requirement of the abstract method from its top-most parent... what's the problem?

Question:
Let $G$ be a nonabelian finite simple group all of whose Sylow subgroups of odd order are cyclic. If we further assume that its Sylow $2$ -subgroup is dihedral, then due to Suzuki, we know that $G\cong \operatorname{PSL}(2,p)$ for a prime $p>3$ . Without any further assumption, what is the  list of finite nonabelian simple groups all of whose Sylow subgroups of odd order are cyclic? Secondly, is there any reference for that not appealing to the full classification of finite simple groups?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Such simple groups are a subset of the finite simple ""thin"" groups, and the latter have been classified (by Michael Aschbacher in 1976 and 1978). A $2$ -local subgroup of a finite group is the normalizer of some non-trivial $2$ -subgroup. A finite simple group $G$ is said to be ""thin"" if all its $2$ -local subgroups have cyclic Sylow subgroups for all odd primes. We may note that Feit and Thompson proved early in their odd order paper (using transfer theorems) that if $G$ is a finite group of odd order which has no elementary Abelian subgroup $p$ -subgroup of rank $3$ or more for any prime $p$ , then $G$ has a normal Sylow $q$ -subgroup where $q$ is the largest prime divisor of $|G|$ .  Hence (without using the full force of the odd order theorem), it is indeed the case that if a finite non-Abelian simple group $G$ has cyclic Sylow subgroups for all odd primes $p$ , then $G$ has even order, and is, in particular, a thin group. However, some thin groups do not satisfy the condition of the question. According to Aschbacher's classification, the list of thin finite simple groups is ${\rm SL}(2,2^{n})$ and ${\rm PSL}(2,q)$ for $q$ an odd prime power (but we can remove the cases when the odd $q$ is not prime in answer to the present question since the Sylow subgroup of order $q$ is not cyclic), ${\rm PSL}(3,4)$ (but we can remove this in answer to the present question since it has a non-cyclic subgroup of order $9$ ), ${\rm PSL}(3,p)$ for $p$ of the form $1+2^{a}3^{b}$ (which can be removed in answer to the present question when $p$ is odd, since there are non-cyclic $p$ -subgroups in that case), ${\rm PSU}(3,p)$ ( $p = 2^{a}3^{b}-1$ , $b \in \{0,1\}$ (but these can be omitted in answer to the present question as there are non-cyclic $p$ -subgroups), ${\rm PSU}(3,2^{n})$ (but these can be omitted in answer to the present question, since ${\rm PSU}(3,4)$ has an elementary Abelian subgroup of order $25$ ), ${\rm Sz}(2^{n})$ , the Tits group $^{2}F_{4}(2)^{\prime}$ (which can be omitted in answer to the present question, as it contains an elementary Abelian subgroup of order $9$ ), the Steinberg triality group $^{3}D_{4}(2)$ (which can be omitted in answer to the present question since it has elementary Abelian subgroups of order $9$ ), the Mathieu group $M_{11}$ (which can be omitted in answer to the present question as it has elementary Abelian subgroups of order $9$ ), and the first Janko group $J_{1}.$ Later edit: Notice that Aschbacher's classification of the thin finite simple groups predates the full classification of the finite simple groups.

","Simply put you can use $q.defer() to create a Promise. A Promise is a function that returns a single value or error in the future . So whenever you have some asynchronous process that should return a value or an error, you can use $q.defer() to create a new Promise. In most cases though, Angular has already done this for you and you can simply use the Promise that is returned, for instance by the $http service. Your example shows a good example of when you'd want to create your own. You see, normally the $http service returns the value from the server, or an error when the http call fails. In your example however you also want to return an error from the Promise (= reject it) when the http call itself success, but has a not-true value for the success property. To do this, the example creates a new Promise whose return value (or error) can then be manually controlled. In this example by calling the resolve() (= return the value) function only when the http call is successful and has data.success == true . In all other cases (when the http call fails or doesn't have the correct data.status value) the newly created Promise is rejected (= return error).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/41107793', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/-1/']}",jdg_352362

Question:
The Fast Fourier Transform algorithm computes a Fourier decomposition under the assumption that its input points are equally spaced in the time domain, $t_k = kT$. What if they're not? Is there another algorithm I could use, or some way I could modify the FFT, to account for what is effectively a variable sampling rate? If the solution depends on how the samples are distributed, there are two particular situations I'm most interested in: Constant sampling rate with jitter: $t_k = kT + \delta t_k$ where $\delta t_k$ is a randomly distributed variable. Suppose it's safe to say $|\delta t_k| < T/2$. Dropped samples from an otherwise constant sampling rate: $t_k = n_k T$ where $n_k \in\mathbb{Z}\ge k$ Motivation: first of all, this was one of the higher voted questions on the proposal for this site. But in addition, a while ago I got involved in a discussion about FFT usage (prompted by a question on Stack Overflow ) in which some input data with unevenly sampled points came up. It turned out that the timestamps on the data were wrong, but it got me thinking about how one could tackle this problem.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","There is a wide variety of techniques for non-uniform FFT, and the most efficient ones are all meant for exactly your case: quasi-uniform samples. The basic idea is to smear the unevenly sampled sources onto a slightly finer (""oversampled"") uniform grid though local convolutions against Gaussians. A standard FFT can then be run on the oversampled uniform grid, and then the convolution against the Gaussians can be undone. Good implementations are something like $C^d$ times more expensive than a standard FFT in $d$ dimensions, where $C$ is something close to 4 or 5. I recommend reading Accelerating the Nonuniform Fast Fourier Transform by Greengard and Lee. There also exist fast, i.e., $O(N^d \log N)$ or faster, techniques when the sources and/or evaluation points are sparse, and there are also generalizations to more general integral operators, e.g., Fourier Integral Operators. If you are interested in these techniques, I recommend Sparse Fourier transform via butterfly algorithm and A fast butterfly algorithm for the computation of Fourier Integral Operators . The price paid in these techniques versus standard FFT's is a much higher coefficient. Disclaimer: My advisor wrote/cowrote those two papers, and I have spent a decent amount of time parallelizing those techniques. An important point is that all of the above techniques are approximations that can be made arbitrarily accurate at the expense of longer runtimes, whereas the standard FFT algorithm is exact.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/593', 'https://scicomp.stackexchange.com', 'https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/users/103/']}",jdg_290831

Question:
I'm measuring text using Paint.getTextBounds() , since I'm interested in getting both the height and width of the text to be rendered. However, the actual text rendered is always a bit wider than the .width() of the Rect information filled by getTextBounds() . To my surprise, I tested .measureText() , and found that it returns a different (higher) value. I gave it a try, and found it correct. Why do they report different widths? How can I correctly obtain the height and width? I mean, I can use .measureText() , but then I wouldn't know if I should trust the .height() returned by getTextBounds() . As requested, here is minimal code to reproduce the problem: final String someText = ""Hello. I believe I'm some text!"";Paint p = new Paint();Rect bounds = new Rect();for (float f = 10; f < 40; f += 1f) {    p.setTextSize(f);    p.getTextBounds(someText, 0, someText.length(), bounds);    Log.d(""Test"", String.format(        ""Size %f, measureText %f, getTextBounds %d"",        f,        p.measureText(someText),        bounds.width())    );} The output shows that the difference not only gets greater than 1 (and is no last-minute rounding error), but also seems to increase with size (I was about to draw more conclusions, but it may be entirely font-dependent): D/Test    (  607): Size 10.000000, measureText 135.000000, getTextBounds 134D/Test    (  607): Size 11.000000, measureText 149.000000, getTextBounds 148D/Test    (  607): Size 12.000000, measureText 156.000000, getTextBounds 155D/Test    (  607): Size 13.000000, measureText 171.000000, getTextBounds 169D/Test    (  607): Size 14.000000, measureText 195.000000, getTextBounds 193D/Test    (  607): Size 15.000000, measureText 201.000000, getTextBounds 199D/Test    (  607): Size 16.000000, measureText 211.000000, getTextBounds 210D/Test    (  607): Size 17.000000, measureText 225.000000, getTextBounds 223D/Test    (  607): Size 18.000000, measureText 245.000000, getTextBounds 243D/Test    (  607): Size 19.000000, measureText 251.000000, getTextBounds 249D/Test    (  607): Size 20.000000, measureText 269.000000, getTextBounds 267D/Test    (  607): Size 21.000000, measureText 275.000000, getTextBounds 272D/Test    (  607): Size 22.000000, measureText 297.000000, getTextBounds 294D/Test    (  607): Size 23.000000, measureText 305.000000, getTextBounds 302D/Test    (  607): Size 24.000000, measureText 319.000000, getTextBounds 316D/Test    (  607): Size 25.000000, measureText 330.000000, getTextBounds 326D/Test    (  607): Size 26.000000, measureText 349.000000, getTextBounds 346D/Test    (  607): Size 27.000000, measureText 357.000000, getTextBounds 354D/Test    (  607): Size 28.000000, measureText 369.000000, getTextBounds 365D/Test    (  607): Size 29.000000, measureText 396.000000, getTextBounds 392D/Test    (  607): Size 30.000000, measureText 401.000000, getTextBounds 397D/Test    (  607): Size 31.000000, measureText 418.000000, getTextBounds 414D/Test    (  607): Size 32.000000, measureText 423.000000, getTextBounds 418D/Test    (  607): Size 33.000000, measureText 446.000000, getTextBounds 441D/Test    (  607): Size 34.000000, measureText 455.000000, getTextBounds 450D/Test    (  607): Size 35.000000, measureText 468.000000, getTextBounds 463D/Test    (  607): Size 36.000000, measureText 474.000000, getTextBounds 469D/Test    (  607): Size 37.000000, measureText 500.000000, getTextBounds 495D/Test    (  607): Size 38.000000, measureText 506.000000, getTextBounds 501D/Test    (  607): Size 39.000000, measureText 521.000000, getTextBounds 515

","You can do what I did to inspect such problem: Study Android source code, Paint.java source, see both measureText and getTextBounds methods.You'd learn that measureText calls native_measureText, and getTextBounds calls nativeGetStringBounds, which are native methods implemented in C++. So you'd continue to study Paint.cpp, which implements both. native_measureText -> SkPaintGlue::measureText_CII nativeGetStringBounds -> SkPaintGlue::getStringBounds Now your study checks where these methods differ.After some param checks, both call function SkPaint::measureText in Skia Lib (part of Android), but they both call different overloaded form. Digging further into Skia, I see that both calls result into same computation in same function, only return result differently. To answer your question: Both your calls do same computation. Possible difference of result lies in fact that getTextBounds returns bounds as integer, while measureText returns float value. So what you get is rounding error during conversion of float to int, and this happens in Paint.cpp in SkPaintGlue::doTextBounds in call to function SkRect::roundOut. The difference between computed width of those two calls may be maximally 1. EDIT 4 Oct 2011 What may be better than visualization. I took the effort, for own exploring, and for deserving bounty :) This is font size 60, in red is bounds rectangle, in purple is result of measureText. It's seen that bounds left part starts some pixels from left, and value of measureText is incremented by this value on both left and right. This is something called Glyph's AdvanceX value. (I've discovered this in Skia sources in SkPaint.cpp) So the outcome of the test is that measureText adds some advance value to the text on both sides, while getTextBounds computes minimal bounds where given text will fit. Hope this result is useful to you. Testing code: protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas){     final String s = ""Hello. I'm some text!"";     Paint p = new Paint();     Rect bounds = new Rect();     p.setTextSize(60);     p.getTextBounds(s, 0, s.length(), bounds);     float mt = p.measureText(s);     int bw = bounds.width();     Log.i(""LCG"", String.format(          ""measureText %f, getTextBounds %d (%s)"",          mt,          bw, bounds.toShortString())      );     bounds.offset(0, -bounds.top);     p.setStyle(Style.STROKE);     canvas.drawColor(0xff000080);     p.setColor(0xffff0000);     canvas.drawRect(bounds, p);     p.setColor(0xff00ff00);     canvas.drawText(s, 0, bounds.bottom, p);  }",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 10, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/7549182', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/469300/']}",jdg_115599

If I have a normal (weak) enumeration, I can use its enumerated values as non-type template parameters, like so: enum { Cat, Dog, Horse };template <int Val, typename T> bool magic(T &t){    return magical_traits<Val>::invoke(t);} and call it as: magic<Cat>(t) as far as I can see, if I have a strongly-typed enumeration and don't want to hard-code the enumeration type, I end up with: enum class Animal { Cat, Dog, Horse };template <typename EnumClass, EnumClass EnumVal, typename T> bool magic(T &t){    return magical_traits<EnumVal>::invoke(t);} and now I have to write: magic<Animal, Animal::Cat>(t) , which seems redundant.

Question:
I am writing a ""server-side extension"" for SmartFoxServer (SFS).  In my login script, I need to make a connection to MS SQL Server, which I am attempting to do using JDBC.  I have tested the JDBC code in my debug environment, and it works fine. BUT When I put the server-side extension in the SFS ""extensions"" folder (as per spec), I'm getting a com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerException : ""This driver is not configured for integrated authentication."". I Googled for this error, and found that it's usually because the file sqljdbc_auth.dll is not in the system path; I have copied this file into a folder in my system path, and still it does not work! Any other suggestions?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","There are different versions of sqljdbc_auth.dll for different processor architectures (x86/x64/ia64).  Which one are you using on your SFS server? You must choose the one to match the architecture of the JVM under which SFS is running.  So, if you're running 32-bit Java on a 64-bit machine, you'll need the x86 version, not the x64 version. I've not used SFS before, so I don't know whether it writes any logs anywhere.  If it does, it might be worth taking a look at these logs to see if anything helpful has been written to them. EDIT :  I can't be 100% sure that SFS is using 64-bit Java just because it runs out of C:\Program Files as opposed to C:\Program Files (x86). I found the following line in the SFS docs under Introduction > Requirements and Installation.  Whilst this line applies only to Linux as opposed to Windows, it might suggest that SFS on Windows also uses 32-bit Java: Since version 1.5 SmartFoxServer comes with its own x86 32-bit Sun Java Runtime. One quick way to determine which version(s) of Java you have installed is, give the following command in your cmd: Java -version It will display the following to the console: C:\Users\967097>java -versionjava version ""1.8.0_131""Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_131-b11)Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.131-b11, mixed mode) Here,you can see the bit type of the java version installed. Does your application work if you use the x86 version of sqljdbc_auth.dll instead of the x64 version?  If it suddenly starts working with the x86 DLL, then SFS must be using 32-bit Java. Is there a batch-file used to start SFS?  If so, reading through that might help point out where SFS is running Java from.  Also look out for any changes to the PATH .  Java can only load DLLs in the java.library.path system property, and on Windows, this is set to the value of the PATH environment variable. If you still can't determine whether SFS is using 32-bit or 64-bit Java, try using Process Explorer to look at the environment that the java.exe process running SFS was started with.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/6087819', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/7850/']}",jdg_174451

Question:
Assume we have a quantum system and its wavefunction $\psi$ , but the wavefunction is not an eigenfunction of some operator (e.g. the z-component of the angular momentum $\hat{L_z}$ ). In this case, how are we going to measure $L_z$ ? Is it always the case that we can write $\psi$ as a sum of eigenfunctions of $\hat{L_z}$ , and from that we extract an $L_z$ measurement?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","There seems to be some sort of misunderstanding here. Making a measurement of observable $A$ of a system in the state $|\psi\rangle$ does not mean we need to get a number from the calculation $A|\psi\rangle$ . The issue here is that $A|\psi\rangle$ is still a vector. If you are expecting the measurement to give a value of $a$ for $A|\psi\rangle=a|\psi\rangle$ then this is still incorrect, as in general $|\psi\rangle$ will not be an eigenvector of $A$ . So how does the operator $A$ relate to the measurement of the observable associated with $A$ ? Well, all you have to do is express $|\psi\rangle$ in the eigenbasis of $A$ $$|\psi\rangle=\sum_nc_n|a_n\rangle$$ Quantum theory tells us that if we were to measure $A$ of our system that all we can determine is the probability of measuring some value $a_n$ . This probability is equal to $|c_n|^2=|\langle a_n|\psi\rangle|^2$ . So, from the operator we can determine two things: Its eigenvalues (possible measurement outcomes) Its eigenvectors (what we can use as basis vectors). And from these two things we can then determine the probability of our system to have a value of $a_n$ when we measure $A$ .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/511983', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/224282/']}",jdg_282515

Question:
By the Hopf-Poincaré theorem, the sum of the indices of the zeros of a vector field on the d-dimensional torus must equal zero. Given an even number of points $x_i$ on a d-dimensional torus, and numbers $n_i=\pm 1$ such that $\sum_i n_i=0$, does there always exist a vector field on the torus which has a zero of index $n_i$ at $x_i$ (and no other zeros)? If so, how would one go about constructing such a vector field?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Yes, this can be done with the Pontryagin-Thom construction. This answer is essentially the same as Pietro Majer's, by the way, but perhaps a bit more ""hands on"" and also more sketchy. The first step is to note that vector fields on the $d$-torus with zeros at points $x_i$ can be constructed from maps from the $d$-torus punctured at each $x_i$ to the $(d-1)$-dimensional sphere $S^{d-1}$. So how do we actually construct a map from this punctured $d$-torus to $S^{d-1}$ such that the degree of the map restricted to a sphere around the puncture $x_i$ is precisely $n_i$? Let us begin by noting that $\sum_i n_i=0$ implies that we can draw disjoint oriented curves in the punctured $d$-torus each beginning and ending at one of the punctures such that the net number of outgoing arrows at each $x_i$ is precisely $n_i$.  (These oriented curves correspond roughly to the paths that the zero-antizeros make under the diffeomorphisms described by Pietro Majer). Here and below I will include some pictures I had lying around which eventually constructs a 2d vector field (actually a line field) in a square patch of the plane with three zeros, one of index -2, and two of index +1. In this first picture I have simply drawn in red curves as the oriented curves that I have just described. The punctures / eventual zeros are the blue points. The idea of the Pontryagin-Thom construction is to identify these oriented curves as the inverse image of the north pole on $S^{d-1}$. Let us now take tubular neighborhoods of these curves which are also all disjoint. A cross-section of each tube is a $(d-1)$-disk with a distinguished normal (pointing along the orientation of the curve) which we map to $S^{d-1}$ by a stereographic projection-like map so that the center of the disk maps to the north pole, the boundary of the disk maps to the south pole, and the orientation of the disk is such that the distinguished normal would correspond to the outward pointing normal of the standard $S^{d-1}$ embedded in $R^d$. In this picture I show the construction of the map in the tubular neighborhoods. I have depicted $\mathbb{RP}^1$ (as the set of orientations of double-headed arrows in the plane) on the right instead of $S^1$ but as the two spaces are homeomorphic the idea is the same.  The red curves map to the north pole, in the case of this $\mathbb{RP}^1$, the vertical direction. The cross-section of the tubular neighborhood in this case is just an interval, and we map the open interval to the circle minus the south pole (or as depicted, $\mathbb{RP}^1$ minus the horizontal direction). This is the meaning of the pink and maroon shaded areas -- they map to the pink and maroon shaded parts of $\mathbb{RP}^1$. We've now constructed a map from the union of the tubular neighborhoods of the oriented curves to $S^{d-1}$. To complete the construction, note that we can map the rest of the punctured $d$-torus to the south pole of $S^{d-1}$ since the boundaries of all the tubular neighborhoods were also mapped there. This picture shows the resulting line field (to get a vector field, simply take the angles of the lines and multiply them all by 2). Observe that in the parts of the picture which were pink, the line field rotates from vertical to horizontal by turning clockwise, and in the maroon parts, the line field rotates from vertical to horizontal by turning counter-clockwise. I leave it to you to check the indices at each of the blue points. I've sketched the construction of a continuous map from the punctured $d$-torus to $S^{d-1}$ - this can be made smooth with partitions of unity. (I believe there are additional restrictions on analytic vector fields, e.g. the fact that meromorphic functions on elliptic curves must have at least two poles) See Milnor's ""Topology from the differentiable viewpoint"" for more details on the Pontryagin-Thom construction.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/153961', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/45250/']}",jdg_360535

My concerns here is that if we want output as map them we have an option from java is like list.parallelStream().collect(Collectors.toConcurrentMap(args)) But there is no option that I can see to collect from parallel stream in thread safe way to provide list as output.I see one more option there to use list.parallelStream().collect(Collectors.toCollection(<Concurrent Implementation>)) in this way we can provide various concurrent implementations in collect method. But I think there is only CopyOnWriteArrayList List implementation is present in java.util.concurrent. We could use various queue implementation here but those will not be like list. What I mean here is that we can workaround to get the list. Could you please guide me what is the best way if I want the output as list? Note: I could not find any other post related to this, any reference would be helpful.

","The Collection object used to receive the data being collected does not need to be concurrent. You can give it a simple ArrayList . That is because the collection of values from a parallel stream is not actually collected into a single Collection object. Each thread will collect their own data, and then all sub-results will be merged into a single final Collection object. This is all well-documented in the Collector javadoc, and the Collector is the parameter you're giving to the collect() method: <R,A> R collect(Collector<? super T,A,R> collector)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/44083445', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/5606133/']}",jdg_323377

Question:
I've spent today researching how to save data using an ajax request in cakephp and have got now where, the documentation on the cakephp website seems a bit lacking for this particular topic. I have several sortable lists and I need to save the position of each list item when one is sorted. I have an ajax request set up as follows that is triggered when an item is moved: $.ajax({                            url: ""/orders/save_column_order"",        type:""POST"",                                                data:""data=""+data       }); and the referenced function in the controller is: function save_column_order(){    if($this->RequestHandler->isAjax()){             SAVE STUFF...        }  } I have the helpers etc. set up: var $helpers = array('Html','Form','Js');var $components = array('Session','Email','RequestHandler'); And its not working... So my questions are: 1) What is the current url for sending an ajax request to an action in a controller? Is it simply /controller/action? 2) What else do I need to do to the controller to access the ajax data? BONUS: 3) Is there a way to include a custom php file in the CakePHP framework that references the database settings so I can manually update my mysql database?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You were very close. 1.) URL is simply /controller/action. Data is passed in $this->data and is magically available in the action.**Since you list 'Js' in your helpers instead of 'Javascript', I'm presuming you're using Cake 1.3.x and jQuery, because jQuery is the default with Cake 1.3 and Js replaced Javascript / Ajax. -- Fix your helpers: var $helpers = array('Html', 'Form', 'Js'=>array(""Jquery"")); -- Fix your jQuery: $.ajax({    url:'/orders/save_column_order',    type:'POST',    data:data}); 2.) Use Cake's magic: function save_column_order() {    if ($this->data != null) {        $this->Model->save($this->data);    // whatever else needs doing...    }} -- Since you're doing ajax, you probably do NOT want Cake's default view-rendering behavior (just a guess.) If you want to render any view at all, it's probably just a snip of markup for an ajax callback, so you probably want to place it in an element rather than a full-blown view: function save_column_order() {    // ...    /* arg 1 - you can specify any view or element you like.        arg 2 - enforces your preferred request handling and layout */    $this->set(compact('vars', 'for', 'view'));    $this->render('/elements/new_column_order', 'ajax'); } -- Otherwise, just suppress rendering: function save_column_order() {    ...         $this->autoRender = false;} -- If your save isn't working, make sure the structure of $this->data is Cake-save-friendly. If you need to view the contents of $this->data, Cake's built-in debugging (from anywhere in your app) will help you get straightened out: debug($this->data); 3.) Wait, what? Not sure I understand what you're asking correctly, so if this does not cover your question, please clarify what you're trying to do? If you mean, will Cake allow you to manually update records in a table/s, yes? Although I'm not sure why you would want to. Cake's extremely powerful built-in ORM is half the point of the framework, and its extremely comprehensive magic is the other half. You can scribble off straight SQL with the Model::sql() method, although this is discouraged it's not very OOP or reusable. When you define associations in your model, you can set the foreign key to false and specify conditions that work like a nested select in Cake's auto joins. If you need to force join/s, Cake's $options['joins'] give you completely granular control; you can designate any type of JOIN if the default LEFT isn't good enough for what you need to do. You can make and break model bindings on the fly with $this->Model->bind() / unbind(). You can specify the level of recursion, apply Containable behavior, specify the fields to select and all conditions. If you need a subquery and Cake just can't get it right, $dbo->buildStatement() will construct your SQL statement and $dbo->expression() will fire it: function intricate() {    $dbo = $this->Rate->Status->getDataSource();    $subquery = $dbo->buildStatement(        array(            'fields' => array('`Status`.`id`'),            'table' => $dbo->fullTableName($this->Rate->Status),            'alias' => 'Status',            'limit' => null,            'offset' => null,            'joins' => array(),            'conditions' => $subqueryConditions,            'order' => null,            'group' => null            ),        $this->Rate->Status        );    $subquery = ""Status.id = ("".$subquery."")"";    $status = $dbo->expression($subquery);    $options['fields']=        array(            ""Rate.id"", ""Rate.plan_id"", ""Rate.status_id"",""Rate.rate"", ""Plan.id"",             ""Plan.company_id"", ""Plan.name"", ""Company.id"", ""Company.name""        );    $options['conditions']=        array(            $status,             ""Geographical.name LIKE '%{$this->zip}%'""        );    $rates = $this->Rate->find('all', $options);    $this->set(compact('rates'));    } -- If you mean - will Cake allow you to swap out database configurations on the fly, yes. However, doing so can get pretty hardcore, especially when Cake's magic is part of the situation. You can add multiple db configs in /app/config/database.php - class DATABASE_CONFIG {    var $default = array(        'driver' => 'mysql',        'persistent' => false,        'host'=>'localhost',        'login' => 'cake',    'password' => 'icing',        'database' => 'dev');    var $offsite = array(        'driver' => 'mysql',        'persistent' => false,        'host' => '11.22.33.44', // or whatever        'login' => 'cake',        'password' => 'frosting',        'database' => 'live');} -- Switching between them in your controller / model is where things get a little intense, depending on the complexity of your situation: // Model::getDataSource()->configKeyName holds whichever db config you're usingif ($this->Model->getDataSource()->configKeyName != 'default') {    // do something, for example, change models, tables, reload schema, etc.    $this->loadModel('Special')    $this->Model->table = 'extras';    $this->Model->schema(true);} else {    // predictably, Model::setDataSource($configKey) changes configs    $this->Model->setDataSource('offsite');} -- If this is what you meant, I can paste a chunk of code I wrote a couple weeks ago requiring I save an ajax form submission (at 2 stages of form completion) to 3 tables in 2 databases (one serving my Cake application, the other serving a legacy CodeIgniter application) showing all this fancy footwork in action along with some good old-fashioned Cake magic join-through save/update shortcuts. (I also had to generate selective emails and finally, fire off a REST request passing the id/s of the newly inserted records to the CI application to trigger it's processing. Whew!)

Question:
Following this Linear Technology ( Analog.com ) Application Note AN47FA (1991), I found these kind of RF PCBs, among many others, very similar (fig.32 p.18 and Fig.F10 p.107). (The images are in B&W because of some aestetics for the document.) Putting aside that these are actually single copper plates, i.e. not PCBs strictly speaking, some of the criteria inferred from the document explanations are: Shorten the output lead lengths, Use a global ground plane, Use a plate behind a connector as reflection plane. But are these techniques actually standardized in more modern RF PCBs? Which should be a more formal guideline for these techniques? Are them somehow superseed by better components of PCB printing technology? Or are these circuits build that way because in that time the PCBs were more expensive? I really doubt this last point, lab techniques for making PCBs were well known at that time, and the same document pointed the soldering made carelessly. Thanks in advance,

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I have to disagree with the legendary Jim Williams (and Bob Pease, who also was known for this technique). These are, in my opinion, not RF circuits. This is a set of techniques to (try to) push the lumped-element model that many circuit designers use up to higher and higher frequencies. Circuit design is generally done with our lumped-element design model - it is the way most of us get taught and most of us ""think"" - we have lumped components such as resistors, transistors, capacitors, etc... connected with connections that have no loss, delay, or inductance. Of course, in practice, these connections do have loss (resistance), an inductance, capacitance, etc. The impact of these non-ideal interconnects become more and more of an issue at higher frequency (mainly the inductance part in this case). As a result, for ''high frequencies\$^1\$'' connections, the model breaks down and these non-ideal components have a significant impact on performance. To reduce this impact as much as possible, Williams' proposes to reduce the parasitic inductance as much as possible. The key is that in ''real'' RF design, we stop thinking about these interconnects as idealized. Instead, we start thinking about impedance matching and modeling interconnects as transmission lines. Once we do, and we use these transmission lines, we no longer need to try and make the interconnects as short as possible to minimize their impact, as we include their impact from the start. This is why all RF design is (or at least should be) done using transmission lines and impedance matching. The advantage of building a circuit as shown here is that it is fast. Just grab a piece of copper prototype board, solder stuff together and voila we have our prototype  board to test with. I think in modern engineering this has changed, as devices have become smaller and smaller and now (at least in my line of work) we design a board to test with during the design phase - testing is a fundamental part of the design process. (if you cannot reliably and repeatedly test a design, you cannot sell it). Note  that even at RF we sometimes  do still design without transmission  lines but then we do need to very accurately model the interconnects to verify performance. So to really answer your question, no, there is no standard guideline like this for RF design because this is not something that is done in much modern production RF design. \$^1\$What is a ''high frequency'' is relative - to a analog designer doing low voltage, high precision measurements a few hundred MHz might be ''high frequency''. For millimeter-wave radar designers, a few GHz is still ''low frequency''.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/382321', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/54870/']}",jdg_269850

","To people reading in 2022 and beyond: you should probably check out the currently next-highest-rated answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/35804945/1691778 My original answer is below. -- @Eric S. Eric S.'s answer is excellent, but I learned by experimentation that this will always cause messages logged at the new debug level to be printed -- regardless of what the log level is set to. So if you make a new level number of 9 , if you call setLevel(50) , the lower level messages will erroneously be printed. To prevent that from happening, you need another line inside the ""debugv"" function to check if the logging level in question is actually enabled. Fixed example that checks if the logging level is enabled: import loggingDEBUG_LEVELV_NUM = 9 logging.addLevelName(DEBUG_LEVELV_NUM, ""DEBUGV"")def debugv(self, message, *args, **kws):    if self.isEnabledFor(DEBUG_LEVELV_NUM):        # Yes, logger takes its '*args' as 'args'.        self._log(DEBUG_LEVELV_NUM, message, args, **kws) logging.Logger.debugv = debugv If you look at the code for class Logger in logging.__init__.py for Python 2.7, this is what all the standard log functions do (.critical, .debug, etc.).

","The best approach is to create a symbolic link like @SlateEntropy very well pointed out in the answer below .

Now any file in /storage/app/public can be accessed via a link like: http://somedomain.com/storage/image.jpg If, for any reason, your can't create symbolic links (maybe you're on shared hosting, etc.) or you want to protect some files behind some access control logic, there is the alternative of having a special route that reads and serves the image.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As I understand it, that requires dependent types , which Rust does not have. This doesn't require dependent types (see comments) but Rust still doesn't have the support needed. As a workaround, you could create a newtype that you verify yourself: #[derive(Debug)]struct Age(u16);impl Age {    fn new(age: u16) -> Option<Age> {        if age <= 100 {            Some(Age(age))        } else {            None        }    }}fn main() {    let age1 = Age::new(30);    let age2 = Age::new(500);    println!(""{:?}, {:?}"", age1, age2);    assert_eq!(        std::mem::size_of::<Age>(),        std::mem::size_of::<u16>()    );} Of course, it doesn't behave exactly like a u16 , but you don't want it to, either! For example, a u16 can go beyond 100... You'd have to reason out if it makes sense to add/subtract/multiply/divide etc your new type as well. For maximum safeguarding, you should move your type and any associated functions into a module. This leverages Rust's visibility rules to prevent people from accidentally accessing the value inside the newtype and invalidating the constraints. You may also want to implement TryFrom (from u16 to your type) or From (from your type to u16 ) to better integrate with generic code. An important thing to note is that this newtype takes the same amount of space as a u16 - the wrapper type is effectively erased when the code is compiled.

In Python, the following statements do not work: f = open(""ftmp"", ""rw"")print >> f, ""python"" I get the error: Traceback (most recent call last):  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>IOError: [Errno 9] Bad file descriptor But with the following code it works: g = open(""ftmp"", ""r+"")print >> g, ""python"" It looks like I need to revise the file modes.

Question:
What is the exact relationship between principal bundles, representations, and vector bundles?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Let G be an algebraic group (or, since the question was tagged as differential geometry, a Lie group).  Then if we're given a principal G-bundle $E_G$ and a representation V of G, we get a vector bundle out of this through the associated bundle construction: $(E_G \times V)/G$ is a vector bundle with generic fiber V.  Here, G acts on $E_G \times V$ as $g(x,v) = (xg^{-1},gv).$ This shows that fixing a G-bundle determines an exact tensor functor from the category of representations of G to the category of vector bundles.  There's a converse to this which says that giving an exact tensor functor from representations of G to vector bundles is equivalent to a G-bundle.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/5772', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/1648/']}",jdg_104681

Question:
How did a ""one-to-one"" function come to mean an injective one? I find it so non-intuitive that I often have to backtrack when reading texts that use ""one-to-one"" because I suddenly discover that I have been internalizing it as ""bijective"". If there was were any logic to the terminology, ""one-to-one"" would mean bijective and injective would be ""(zero-or-one)-to-one"". Perhaps I would be able to remember it better if I knew of any way to make ""one-to-one""=""injective"" make some kind of logical sense, however tenuous. Can anyone suggest one, please? (To clarify, I know (?) that ""one-to-one"" is older than ""injective"", but that doesn't in itself explain how the ancients got the idea of using such a strange and illogical term in the first place.)

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","In the old usage, as well as contemporary usage in set theory, one may consider a function without specifying a particular codomain or target set. (The insistence that a function come along with a particular codomain is a comparatively recent innovation, probably arising in Bourbaki.) That is, if one understands a function merely to be a set of ordered pairs satisfying the function property (that each input is associated to one output), or as a rule associating to every object in a domain an output value, then it is true to say that a function is one-to-one if and only if it is a bijection from its domain to its range. Thus, injective functions really are one-to-one in the sense that you want. Of course, this one-to-one terminology was long established by the time Bourbaki wanted to insist that functions come along with a specified co-domain, giving the definition of function as a triple consisting of domain, codomain and set of ordered pairs. The fact that in this context the concept of one-to-one doesn't tell the whole story may be part of the reason that they introducted the injective, surjective, bijective terminology. But meanwhile, a function is one-to-one if and only if it provides a one-to-one correspondence between its domain and its range. This is perfectly logical, and seems to be the explanation that you are seeking. I would think that the one-to-one terminology   begins to seem illogical only when one also insists on attaching to the function a target set or codomain that is not the same as its range, which is, after all, a somewhat illogical thing to do.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/63154', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/14366/']}",jdg_352638

Question:
I'm trying on code push in my Visual studio project now. I done installing cordova plugin code push and able to see the instance with console.log(codePush) . Now I try to run codePush.checkForUpdate() and I notice that I need to fill in the Deployment Key in config.xml. I read several articles about deployment key but all of them use the Ionic CLI to create the project and they can retrieve the deployment key in CLI. But I don't see any option in Visual Studio for that nor see any deployment key info anywhere. Please advice on how to get the deployment key for my Visual Studio project in order to enable codePush.

","After many hours of struggle, I found a solution on this. As a result, I actually need to follow EVERY single step as provided here , here and here . I really need to cross check between these 3 links to make things work. Here is what I did: 1) In Visual Studio Package Manager Console, do this npm install -g code-push-cli . This will install the necessary for CodePush CLI 2) In the console, do code-push register . This will open a browser and register your account and associate with github or microsoft platform for code sync later on. 3) After successful registration, do code-push login . This will open up the browser and generate an access key for you. Suppose, a CLI will pop up and allow you to key in the access key for login. But in my case, the console hang. So I have to do code-push login --accessKey <accessKey> method to login. 4) After that, do code-push app add <app_name> to register the app. This will send info to code push server and allow your app to perform code push 5) Do code-push deployment add <app_name> ""Staging"" to enable the app for deployment to server 6) When adding for deployment is successful, do code-push deployment ls <app_name> -k to retrieve the Deployment Key for Staging and Production I still need to trial-and-error for using the code in the application. But at least I'm manage to get the deployment key for now.

Question:
Related to: What happens if there is a runtime error? This question is similar to the one above, however this is an alternate situation: int pin = 999;pinMode(pin, OUTPUT);digitalWrite(pin, HIGH); What would happen in this instance? The compiler might catch it but if you used a random number would the IDE catch it?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The compiler will not detect any error and the code will compile and execute. Hence, to see what happens we need to explore the behind-the-scenes magic. For a summary, skip to end. The second line in your code is where the magic will happen and thats where we need to focus. pinMode(pin, OUTPUT); The portion of pinMode relevant to this discussion is: void pinMode(uint8_t pin, uint8_t mode) {    uint8_t bit = digitalPinToBitMask(pin); //The first instance where pin is used    uint8_t port = digitalPinToPort(pin);    if (port == NOT_A_PIN) return;//Do something} (The complete implementation can be found in wiring_digital.c ) So, here, digitalPinToBitMask seems to be using pin to compute an intermediate bit. Exploring further, digitalPinToBitMask is a macro defined in Arduino.h whose definition is this one-liner: #define digitalPinToBitMask(P) ( pgm_read_byte( digital_pin_to_bit_mask_PGM + (P) ) ) This weird looking one liner does a very simple task. It indexes the P th element in the array digital_pin_to_bit_mask_PGM and returns it. This array digital_pin_to_bit_mask_PGM is defined in pins_arduino.h or the pin map for the specific board being used. const uint8_t PROGMEM digital_pin_to_bit_mask_PGM[] = {    _BV(0), /* 0, port D */    _BV(1),    _BV(2),    _BV(3),    _BV(4),    _BV(5),    _BV(6),    _BV(7),...}; This array has 20 elements in total, so we are out of luck. 999 will index a memory location in the flash memory outside of this array, thereby leading to unpredictable behavior. Or will it? We still have another line of defense against runtime anarchy. Its the next line of the function pinMode : uint8_t port = digitalPinToPort(pin); digitalPinToPort takes us along a similar path. It is defined as a macro along with digitalPinToBitMask . Its definition is: #define digitalPinToPort(P) ( pgm_read_byte( digital_pin_to_port_PGM + (P) ) ) Now, we index the P th element of digital_pin_to_port_PGM which is an array defined in the pin map: const uint8_t PROGMEM digital_pin_to_port_PGM[] = {    PD, /* 0 */    PD,    ....    PC,    PC,}; This array contains 20 elements, so 999 is again out of range. Again, this command reads and returns a value from flash memory of whose value we cannot be certain. This will again lead to unpredictable behavior from here on. There is still one last line of defense. That is the if check in pinMode on the return value of digitalPinToPort : if (port == NOT_A_PIN) return; NOT_A_PIN is defined as 0 in Arduino.h . So, if the returned byte from digitalPinToPort happens to be zero, then pinMode will silently fail and return. In any case, pinMode cannot save us from anarchy. 999 is destined to result in doom. TL;DR, the code will execute and the result of this will be unpredictable. Most likely, no pin will be set to OUTPUT , and digitalWrite will fail. If you happen to have exceptionally bad luck, then a random pin may get set to OUTPUT , and digitalWrite may set it to HIGH .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/274', 'https://arduino.stackexchange.com', 'https://arduino.stackexchange.com/users/220/']}",jdg_316977

Question:
Just curious: In Kotlin, I would love to get some val that can be initialized by lazy, but with a parameter. That's because I need something that's created very late in order to initialize it. Specifically, I wish I had: private lateinit val controlObj:SomeView or: private val controlObj:SomeView by lazy { view:View->view.findViewById(...)} and then: override fun onCreateView(....) {    val view = inflate(....)    controlObj = view.findViewById(...) or in the 2nd case controlObj.initWith(view) or something like that: return view I cannot use by lazy because by lazy won't accept external parameters to be used when initialising. In this example - the containing view . Of course I have lateinit var but it would be nice if I could make sure it becomes read only after setting and I could do it in one line. Is there a pretty clean way to create a read only variable that initializes only once but only when some other variables are born? Any init once keyword? That after init the compiler knows it's immutable? I am aware of the potential concurrency issues here but if I dare to access it before init, I surely deserve to be thrown .

Question:
Constant current sources (simply, current sources ) are useful and necessary devices. They are widely used to drive LEDs, charge capacitors and batteries, to bias differential amplifiers, etc. The only problem is... there are no such devices in nature; almost all of sources are (constant) voltage sources. So we have to make them. Many specific circuit solutions of current sources are discussed in other questions. But it is interesting to see the general ideas on which they are based… the “philosophy” behind them. If we know it, we will be able to understand completely unknown circuit solutions… and even to create new specific current source implementations. So what are the basic ideas behind current sources? How are they implemented in practice? Why are they implemented exactly in such a way? What do active elements in these circuits do? What functions do they perform? I would like not only to know specific circuit solutions... I want to understand them... to see the idea behind them... ""the forest for the trees"". Intuitive and imaginative explanations are welcome.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I will expose my philosophy in a few consecutive steps each of them illustrated by a colorful picture. The left part a is a conceptual electrical circuit illustrating the basic idea; the right part b is an exemplary electronic circuit based on this idea. The quantities do not have exact values. The representation by voltage bars is approximate but the voltage polarities and current directions are real, not arbitrary. In most cases below, I suppose that current sources produce constant current and the load (usually resistive type) varies its resistance as a disturbance. This arrangement best reveals the current source behavior when disturbed. For the purpose of understanding on this intuitive level, when introducing concepts, I have used an unconventional language where, to elicit associations with well-known phenomena, terms are descriptive and figurative. These are well-known techniques for creative thinking. However, the applications are explained in conventional terms. I have managed to extract six fundamental techniques from the variety of specific current source implementations. I will be happy if you can enrich them with more. Are current sources really sources? ""True"" current source. The simplest electrical circuit possible consists of two elements - source and load (Fig. 1a). Here the source is a true current source (in the sense it can ""produce"" energy). The simplest load is a resistor with resistance RL. Fig. 1. Analog current loop interface Both current and resistance can vary depending on the specific application. For example, an analog current loop interface is shown in Fig. 1b. At the input of the long line, the input voltage VIN is converted to current I by a voltage-controlled current source . Then, at the output of the line, the current is converted back to a voltage drop across the resistor RL. In this arrangement, varying current flows through constant resistance and creates varying voltage drop across it. This voltage is defined by Ohm's law and can be significant. In other examples below, the current will be constant and the resistance will vary. The point of using a current interface is that the current source overcomes any undesired resistances and voltage drops along the line by increasing its internal voltage or reducing its internal resistance (see Fig. 4-7 below). ""Untrue"" current source. Electronic circuits are supplied by a power supply which negative terminal (usually) serves as a ground (Fig. 2a). The pair of source and load above is usually ""stretched"" between the supply rails. More frequently, the source is connected to the negative supply rail (ground) and acts as a sink ; the load is connected to the positive rail and acts as a pull-up element . The current source is not true in the sense it cannot ""produce"" energy. Fig. 2. Voltage-shifting circuit solution (in Widlar's 702 op-amp) Each of the three attributes - current, resistance and voltage, can vary depending on the specific application. Let's for example consider the more interesting situation where the voltage varies while both current and resistance stay constant - the so called ""voltage shifting"". This technique is applied by Bob Widlar in the internal structure of his first op-amp 702 (Fig. 2b). Let's consider this ingenious circuit solution. The emitter follower Q5 acts as the voltage source V from the conceptual Fig. 2a and sets the voltage of the upper end of R5. The current ""source"" Q9 sets constant current through R5 and accordingly, constant voltage across it. Thus the resistor R5 acts as a kind of ""Zener diode"" that ""shifts"" down the voltage variations of Q5 emitter to Q6 base. How do we create current sources? 1. Static resistor. Аlthough, in electronic circuits, the element ""producing"" the current I is represented by the symbol of a current source, it is not a source in the literal sense of the word because it does not ""produce"" power; on the contrary, it consumes power. You can convince yourself by seeing that, in Fig. 2a above, the voltage polarity of the current source does not correspond to the current direction. If it was a source with a big enough current magnitude, it could change the polarity... but it cannot... and the voltage magnitude is limited to the supply voltage. So, this mysterious element is something like a resistor. In the simplest case, it is exactly a resistor (RI in Fig. 3a). What is the need of this resistor? Fig. 3. BJT current mirror Basically, to produce current, according to Ohm's law I = V/RL, we need only the voltage V and load resistance RL. The problem of this extremely simple ""current source"" is the current will be totally determined by the load... and when the load varies, the current will vary as well. That is why, to suppress the load resistance RL, we connect an additional resistor RI. An example of such a ""resistor"" current source is the input part of the BJT current mirror (Fig. 3b above). The resistor RI sets the current through the T1 output part acting as an ""active diode"". The current is relatively constant since the load does not significantly vary. In the case of varying load resistance, we can increase RI. The higher RI is, the more the current will depend on it... and will not depend on the load variations - I = V/(RI + RL); only the current will be small since the voltage is constant and limited. But if we increase enormously both voltage V and resistance RI, RL will become negligible compared to RI... and we will come to the well-known definition of the ideal current source from textbooks on electrical engineering - a source with infinite high voltage and resistance. They are high but constant (static)... and this is the trouble causing big power losses in RI. An example of such a ""perfect"" current source made in this silly way, is a LED powered through a (big) resistor by the mains. 2. Dynamic resistor. In electronic circuits, we do it in a more clever way - by varying RI oppositely to RL variations. As a result, the total resistance is constant... and the current is constant as well (Fig. 4a). RI is dynamic but low... so the power losses are low. We have the illusion of extremely high (differential) resistance but the actual (static) resistance is low. Fig. 4. BJT current source (sink) In practice, dynamic resistors are implemented by transistors (BJT, MOSFET) having such a behavior. For example, a simple BJT current source is built in this way on Fig. 4b. 3. Dynamic voltage source. In the arrangement above, to keep the current constant, we varied the resistance RI while keeping the voltage V constant. With the same success, we can vary the voltage V while keeping the resistance RI constant... i.e., supply the RI-RL network by a ""dynamic voltage source"" (Fig. 5a). For example, if RL increases its resistance, the voltage drop VL = I.RL across it will increase... but the voltage source will increase its voltage V with the same value... and the current I = V/(RI + RL) will not change. Figuratively speaking (for the imaginative), the voltage increase removes the load resistance increase... as though it acts as equivalent negative resistance that removes the positive resistance increase. Fig. 5. Improved Howland current pump An excellent implementation of this technique is the ingenious circuit solution of the so-called ""improved Howland current pump"" (Fig. 5b). Here the op-amp acts as the dynamic voltage source V which output voltage is ""lifted"" (by the inverting input) with the constant voltage VRI above the load voltage VL. The output voltage follows the variations of the load voltage VL by the mechanism of a positive feedback. The combination of the op-amp and the four resistors R can be thought as two cascaded circuits - the voltage divider on the right with ratio of R/(R + R) = 1/2 and the non-inverting amplifier on the left with gain of (R + R)/R = 2. Thus the total transfer ratio of the whole circuit is 1 and the load voltage variations (at the lower end of RI) appear at the op-amp output (at the upper end of RI). As a result, there is a constant voltage drop across the constant resistor RI; so the current through RI and RL is constant (does not depend on the load). The circuit can be thought as of a ""shifted voltage follower"" that behaves as a current source with extremely high differential internal resistance. Note, although there are two kinds of feedback - negative and positive, this current source does not use any feedback to keep the current constant ... it is a current source without negative feedback. The circuit blindly correct the input voltage without monitoring the final result - the load current. That is why, the resistances should be precise. 4. Additional voltage source. The ""improved Howland idea"" is brilliant but in many cases we cannot change the supply voltage according to the load voltage (for example, when it is at a great distance from the load). Then another great idea helps us - instead of increasing the supply voltage with the increase needed, we add it by connecting another voltage source VH in series (and in the same direction) to the main voltage source V (Fig. 6a). The result is the same but there is a crucial advantage - we can place this ""helping"" voltage source close to the load. We can see this idea in the ubiquitous circuit of the op-amp inverting amplifier if we draw it in a more unusual way (Fig. 6b). The elements with positive voltages are drawn above the zero voltage line (ground); the elements with negative voltages are drawn below the zero voltage line. As though, the lower circuit part is a mirror copy of the upper part. Fig. 6. Op-amp inverting amplifier To add its output voltage VOA to the input voltage VIN, the op-amp is forced to go below zero; hence the need of the additional negative power supply V-. As you can see from the circuit diagram, the op-amp output voltage ""source"" VOA (VH in the conceptual picture a ) is connected in series to the input voltage source VIN (V); so their voltages are summed. The circuit can be thought as of a bridge circuit where the voltages on the left are equal to the corresponding voltage drops across the resistors on the right. Again (for the imaginative), the op-amp output voltage VOA compensates the voltage drop VL across the load... as though it acts as equivalent (current-controlled aka VNIC) negative resistance that removes the positive load resistance. As a result, the combination of the op-amp, V- and RL acts as a ""piece of wire""... the so-called virtual ground ... and the current depends only on the resistance RI and the input voltage VIN (it does not depend on RL). An interesting fact is, as above, although there is a negative feedback in this inverting circuit, actually this current source does not use a negative feedback to keep the current constant... it is a current source without negative feedback. It uses the mechanism of the negative feedback only to copy the voltage across the load at the op-amp output with the purpose to destroy it then by subtracting. 5. Negative feedback. Of course, the perfect technique is to monitor the final result - the current produced; thus all kinds of disturbances will be compensated. For this purpose, first we convert the current to a voltage drop by passing it through a current sense resistor RI (Fig. 7a). Then we compare this voltage drop with the reference voltage VREF by means of comparing device (zero voltage indicator in this conceptual picture)... and change the current by the variable resistance R (or the voltage V). Let's see how this idea is implemented in the classic common-emitter stage with emitter degeneration acting as a current source (Fig. 7b) Fig. 7. Transistor current source with emitter degeneration The reference voltage VREF is ""produced"" by the voltage divider R1-R2. The load current passes through the emitter resistor RE (RI in Fig. 7a) and ""creates"" proportional voltage VE = IL.RE across it. The transistor T compares these voltages by its base-emitter junction and changes its dynamic ""resistance"" RT (R in Fig. 7a) until VE becomes (almost) equal to VREF (it would be exactly equal by including the emitter follower T in the negative feedback of an op-amp). So, if RL varies, RT will vary in opposite direction so that the total network resistance RL + RT + RE stays constant... and, as the supply voltage VCC is constant, the current IL = VCC/(RL + RT + RE) passing through the network is constant. Then, since circuits with negative feedback are so good, why are circuits without negative feedback still widely used? Compare the conceptual Fig. 7a with all other figures and you will find the answer - it contains one resistor in more that is needed to sense the current. The problem is not the very resistor but the voltage drop across it. That is why, the input part of the simple BJT current mirror (Fig. 3b) is built without negative feedback. 6. Additional current source. In Fig. 6 above, we compensated the ""undesired"" voltage drop across the load by adding a supplementing voltage VH to the main supply voltage V. For this purpose, we connected an additional ""helping"" voltage source in series to the load. With the same success we can directly compensate the load current decrease (due to RL) by adding additional current to the initial load current. Let's see what its magnitude is. The current produced by the simplest current source in Fig. 3a is IL = (VIN - VL)/RI = VIN/RI - VL/RI. It differs from the desired current IL =VIN/RL by the term (error) VL/RI… and this is the magnitude of the additional current that we have to add to remove the error. So we can connect a ""helping"" current source producing the current IH = VL/RI in parallel to the load (Fig. 8a) and its current will complement the decreased load current to the desired constant magnitude. More precisely, it is a voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) driven by the load voltage VL. Fig. 8. Classic Howland current pump This idea is implemented in an ingenious way in the original Howland current pump (Fig. 8b). I will explain it in two ways - conventional and imaginative. According to the general idea above, we can see three devices in parallel: an imperfect input current source , a ""helping"" current source and a load RL. The imperfect current source is implemented by the input voltage source VIN with a resistor R in series. The ""helping"" current source consists of the op-amp and the other three resistors R. This combination can be considered as a non-inverting amplifier (consisting of the op-amp and the voltage divider of two R) with a gain of 2. Its output voltage (twice the load voltage VL) is converted to the current IH = VL/R that is injected back into the load. As a result, the load current increases - IL = IIN + IH = (VIN - VL)/R + VL/R = VIN/R. So it does not depend on the load voltage. With more imagination, we can see in this VCCS another type of negative resistance - voltage-controlled aka INIC. Now it neutralizes the positive internal resistance R of the imperfect input voltage source making it infinite high. Like in the improved Howland current pump , there are two kinds of feedback - negative and positive... but the negative feedback is not used to keep the current constant. The circuit blindly ""calculates"" the correcting current IH without monitoring the final result - the load current. That is why, the resistances R should be precise.

","To be clear, whenever requests receives a redirect (with a certain status code ) we have to perform certain transformations on the request. In cases like this, when you see something very unexpected the best debugging tips are to retry your request but with allow_redirects=False . This will immediately return the 30x response. Alternatively, you can also check r.history to see if there are any 30x responses that were followed.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You can hook the click event on btnHotelSearchAll and then fill in the value: document.getElementById(""btnHotelSearchAll"").onclick = function() {    document.getElementById(""Hotel"").value = ""0"";}; Be absolutely certain there's nothing else on the page that has either the id or name ""Hotel"", and that you don't have any global variables you've declared with that name, because some versions of IE have bugs where they conflate name values and global variable names into the namespace they use for document.getElementById . Or, alternately, make the id on the hidden field a bit more unique (the name can stay as it is so you don't have to change the backend; the id is only client-side, the name is what's sent to the server). E.g., you can do this: <input type=""hidden"" id=""HotelField"" name=""Hotel"" value=""<%= HotelID %>"">                              ^ and then change the code a bit: document.getElementById(""btnHotelSearchAll"").onclick = function() {    document.getElementById(""HotelField"").value = ""0"";    //                            ^}; Update : Note that the code to hook up the button must run after the button has been put in the DOM. So with the code above, that means making sure that the script block is below the form in the page, like this: <form ...>....</form>...<script>...</script> If the script block is above the button, then the button won't exist yet as of when the script runs. This is one reason why it's frequently best to put scripts at the end of the body element, just before the closing </body> tag ( more here ). If you really want the script above the button, you have to delay the call by making it an onload event handler or that sort of thing. But window.onload happens very late in the process of a page load (it waits for all images and other assets to load, for instance), long after your users may be interacting with your form, so usually best to do it sooner. Off-topic : My standard note that a lot of this stuff is made earlier and more robust by using a decent JavaScript library like jQuery , Prototype , YUI , Closure , or any of several others . jQuery, for instance, will deal with the IE bugs in document.getElementById for you so you don't have to worry about the conflation problem.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/6597444', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/295302/']}",jdg_71094

Question:
We have a Microsoft.Win32 Namespace but is it guaranteed to work in 64-bit Windows environments? Is there an equivalent need to have such definitions for a 64-bit situation?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
",".NET applications by default run on the framework which targets the architecture of the OS. So, if you're running 32 bit Windows, the .NET framework installed on the machine would be the 32 bit framework. All .NET applications running on this framework would then run in ""32 bit"". If you're running 64 bit Windows then you're running a 64 bit framework but the IL that's running on top of the framework doesn't differ (by default) from that of the 32 bit IL. So in short: it doesn't matter if you're running 32 bit or 64 bit Windows since the .NET framework abstracts that away from the C#/VB code. The Microsoft.Win32 framework refers to the native APIs inside of Windows. Short of the really bad name that Microsoft has given it, it has nothing to do with 32 bit vs 64 bit Windows. Incidentally, there are some things you can't do with the 64 bit version of the framework: for example, there isn't a JET database driver in the 64 bit framework.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/982625', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/22944/']}",jdg_94768

Question:
One idea I used to hear a lot about was that when people are near-death and saved by medical science that they sometimes see ""a light at the end of a tunnel"" in a vision. Today I read about an article about a new best-seller from an ambitious 4-year-old in Nebraska : 'I met great granddad...and he had wings': Boy who 'went to heaven' is now best selling author . Here's his #1 New York Times Bestselling book ""Heaven is for Real"" on Amazon : The only problem is that I remember seeing shows on TV that suggest near-death experiences can be repeated in a controlled environment . Is there any evidence to suggest that near-death experiences and ""the light at the end of the tunnel"" have a scientific explanation?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","There is ample scientific explanations for the physiological reactions that people experience.  From PubMed (my emphasis): The Near-Death Experience (NDE) is a dissociative mental state with characteristic features. These can be reproduced by ketamine which acts at sigma sites and blocks N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) linked phencyclidine (PCP) receptors to reduce ischaemic damage. Endogenous ligands, alpha and beta-endopsychosin, have been detected for these receptors which suggests an explanation for some NDE's: the endopsychosins may be released in abnormal quantity to protect neurons from ischaemic and other excitotoxic damage, and the NDE is a side effect on consciousness with important psychological functions. The light in the tunnel effect is an easy one, since I have personally experienced it numerous times in a high-G environment.  Your eyes naturally create a tunnel effect as they start to lose oxygen. As for seeing loved ones, in the case of this particular book, that is more likely a post hoc occurrence for financial gain as well as societally influenced expectations.  The personal history and background of the boy Colton, and the author Todd Burpo, align exactly with what they wrote about (isn't it funny that no one ever experiences a ""vision"" that would be opposed to their expectations and personal history, like a christian seeing Vishnu for instance?). And it is established that autobiographical memories can be implanted in individuals , and that children are especially susceptible to this. Loftus (1997) investigated memory distortion and the relation with the degree of confidence in the existence of a false memory. She calls this phenomenon the ""misinformation effect"". She observed that if witnesses of an event are later exposed to new and misleading information about it, their recollections become distorted (Loftus, 1997). Loftus was able to empirically demonstrate this phenomenon with autobiographical memories. With corroboration from the participants' family members, Loftus was relatively successful at implanting false autobiographical memories. EDIT TO ADD : I just found this article today that is relevant to this answer . This week, in “ The neurology of near-death experiences “, Alex debunks the religious trappings that attach to the “out-of-body” and similar experiences that occur in conjunction with operations and medical episodes.  In particular, he shows that experiences such as dreamlike states, tunnel vision, and leaving and returning to one’s body are all phenomena that have well-understood medical causes.  Some of them can even be reproduced by stimulating people’s brains. I suggest anyone interested in the subject check out the links.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/1311', 'https://skeptics.stackexchange.com', 'https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/users/49/']}",jdg_302127

These two are nearly the same, but why the fitted graph don't fit the actual point well, there must be something wrong in the fitted graph, or the way I draw the fitted graph and actual points is totally wrong, what should I do? After I get the parameter of the model I establish, in which way I evaluate the model, something like RSS(residual square sum) for linear model, or the p-value of shapiro.test() , ks.test() and other test? I am poor in statistical knowledge, could you kindly help me out? ps: I have search in the Google, stackoverflow and CV many times, but found nothing related to this problem

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Question 1 The way you calculate the density by hand seems wrong. There's no need for rounding the random numbers from the gamma distribution. As @Pascal noted, you can use a histogram to plot the density of the points. In the example below, I use the function density to estimate the density and plot it as points. I present the fit both with the points and with the histogram: library(ggplot2)library(MASS)# Generate gamma rvsx <- rgamma(100000, shape = 2, rate = 0.2)den <- density(x)dat <- data.frame(x = den$x, y = den$y)# Plot density as pointsggplot(data = dat, aes(x = x, y = y)) +   geom_point(size = 3) +  theme_classic() # Fit parameters (to avoid errors, set lower bounds to zero)fit.params <- fitdistr(x, ""gamma"", lower = c(0, 0))# Plot using density pointsggplot(data = dat, aes(x = x,y = y)) +   geom_point(size = 3) +       geom_line(aes(x=dat$x, y=dgamma(dat$x,fit.params$estimate[""shape""], fit.params$estimate[""rate""])), color=""red"", size = 1) +   theme_classic() # Plot using histogramsggplot(data = dat) +  geom_histogram(data = as.data.frame(x), aes(x=x, y=..density..)) +  geom_line(aes(x=dat$x, y=dgamma(dat$x,fit.params$estimate[""shape""], fit.params$estimate[""rate""])), color=""red"", size = 1) +   theme_classic() Here is the solution that @Pascal provided: h <- hist(x, 1000, plot = FALSE)t1 <- data.frame(x = h$mids, y = h$density)ggplot(data = t1, aes(x = x, y = y)) +   geom_point(size = 3) +       geom_line(aes(x=t1$x, y=dgamma(t1$x,fit.params$estimate[""shape""], fit.params$estimate[""rate""])), color=""red"", size = 1) +   theme_classic() Question 2 To assess the goodness of fit I recommend the package fitdistrplus . Here is how it can be used to fit two distributions and compare their fits graphically and numerically. The command gofstat prints out several measures, such as the AIC, BIC and some gof-statistics such as the KS-Test etc. These are mainly used to compare fits of different distributions (in this case gamma versus Weibull). More information can be found in my answer here : library(fitdistrplus)x <- c(37.50,46.79,48.30,46.04,43.40,39.25,38.49,49.51,40.38,36.98,40.00,       38.49,37.74,47.92,44.53,44.91,44.91,40.00,41.51,47.92,36.98,43.40,       42.26,41.89,38.87,43.02,39.25,40.38,42.64,36.98,44.15,44.91,43.40,       49.81,38.87,40.00,52.45,53.13,47.92,52.45,44.91,29.54,27.13,35.60,       45.34,43.37,54.15,42.77,42.88,44.26,27.14,39.31,24.80,16.62,30.30,       36.39,28.60,28.53,35.84,31.10,34.55,52.65,48.81,43.42,52.49,38.00,       38.65,34.54,37.70,38.11,43.05,29.95,32.48,24.63,35.33,41.34)fit.weibull <- fitdist(x, ""weibull"")fit.gamma <- fitdist(x, ""gamma"", lower = c(0, 0))# Compare fits graphicallypar(mfrow = c(2, 2))plot.legend <- c(""Weibull"", ""Gamma"")denscomp(list(fit.weibull, fit.gamma), fitcol = c(""red"", ""blue""), legendtext = plot.legend)qqcomp(list(fit.weibull, fit.gamma), fitcol = c(""red"", ""blue""), legendtext = plot.legend)cdfcomp(list(fit.weibull, fit.gamma), fitcol = c(""red"", ""blue""), legendtext = plot.legend)ppcomp(list(fit.weibull, fit.gamma), fitcol = c(""red"", ""blue""), legendtext = plot.legend) @NickCox rightfully advises that the QQ-Plot (upper right panel) is the best single graph for judging and comparing fits.

","You use a proof by contradiction. Basically, you suppose that $\sqrt{2}$ can be written as $\dfrac{p}{q}$ . Then you know that $2q^2=p^2$ . As squares of integers, both $q^2$ and $p^2$ have an even number of factors of two.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","window.location is an accessor property, and getting its value gives you an object, not a string, and so it doesn't have an indexOf function. (It's perfectly understandable that people sometimes think it's a string, since when you set its value, the accessor property's setter accepts a string; that is, window.location = ""some url""; actually works. But when you get it, you don't get a string.) You can use window.location.toString() , String(window.location) , or window.location.href to get a string for it if you like, or use any of its various properties to check specifics.

Question:
How do you prove that any collection of sets $\{X_n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ such that for every $n \in \mathbb{N}$ the set $X_n$ is equinumerous to the set of natural numbers, then the union of all these sets, $\bigcup_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ $X_i$ is also equinumerous to the set of natural numbers? (By equinumerous I mean there exists a one-to-one and onto function $f:X_n \to \mathbb{N}$ .) Is this statement false as it stands?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The answer depends on your set theory. If your set theory includes the Axiom of (Countable) Choice, then you can proceed as follows: For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, select a bijection $f_n\colon X_n\to\mathbb{N}$. (This step requires the Axiom of Countable Choice); Select a bijection $g\colon\mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$; there are several explicit examples of this. For example, the Cantor pairing function $g(p,q) = \frac{(p+q)(p+q+1)}{2}+q$. Define $f\colon \bigcup\limits_{n\in\mathbb{N}}(X_n\times\{n\})\to \mathbb{N}$ by mapping $(x,n)$ to $g(f_n(x),n)$. This defines a bijection between the disjoint union of the $X_n$ onto $\mathbb{N}$. To get a bijection in the case where the $X_n$ are not disjoint, note that $\bigcup\limits_{n\in\mathbb{N}} X_n$ embeds into the disjoint union (map $x$ in the union to $(x,m)$ where $m$ is the smallest $n\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $x\in X_n$), which is bijectable to $\mathbb{N}$; then use the Cantor-Bernstein Theorem applied to this embedding and to embedding that maps $\mathbb{N}$ to $X_1$ into the union to get a bijection. However, if your set theory does not include the Axiom of Choice, then the answer may be that the union need not be bijectable with $\mathbb{N}$. In particular, it is consistent with ZF that the real numbers are a countable union of countable sets, and of course the real numbers are not bijectable with $\mathbb{N}$.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/55181', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/7667/']}",jdg_361798

","If last_updated is a naive datetime object representing the time in UTC: from datetime import datetime, timedeltaif (datetime.utcnow() - last_updated) > timedelta(hours=24):     # more than 24 hours passed If last_updated is the local time (naive (timezone-unaware) datetime object): import timeDAY = 86400now = time.time()then = time.mktime(last_updated.timetuple())if (now - then) > DAY:    # more than 24 hours passed If last_updated is an ambiguous time e.g., the time during an end-of-DST transition (once a year in many timezones) then there is a fifty-fifty chance that mktime() returns a wrong result (e.g., off by an hour). time.mktime() may also fail if C time library doesn't use a historical timezone database on a given platform and the UTC offset for the local timezone was different at last_updated time compared to now. It may apply to more than a third of all timezones in the last year. Linux, OS X, the recent versions of Windows have the tz database (I don't know whether old Windows versions would work for such past dates). Beware: it might be tempting to write datetime.now() - last_updated (similar to the UTC case) but it is guaranteed to fail on all platforms if the UTC offset was different at last_updated time (it is possible in many timezones). mktime() -based solution can utilize the tz database at least on some platforms and therefore it can handle the changes in the UTC offset for whatever reason there. For portability, you could install the tz database. It is provided by pytz module in Python. tzlocal can return pytz timezone corresponding to the local timezone: from datetime import datetime, timedeltafrom tzlocal import get_localzone # $ pip install tzlocaltz = get_localzone() # local timezonethen = tz.normalize(tz.localize(last_updated)) # make it timezone-awarenow = datetime.now(tz) # timezone-aware current time in the local timezoneif (now - then) > timedelta(hours=24):    # more than 24 hours passed It works even if the UTC offset was different in the past. But it can't (as well as time.mktime() ) fix ambiguous times ( tz.localize() picks is_dst=False time by default). tz.normalize() is called to adjust non-existing times e.g., those that correspond to a start-of-DST transition (it should not affect the result). The above code assumes that last_updated is a naive datetime object (no associated timezone info).

Question:
The biggest misunderstanding for me in Swift is the throws keyword. Consider the following piece of code: func myUsefulFunction() throws We cannot really understand what kind of error it will throw. The only thing we know is that it might throw some error. The only way to understand what the error might be is by looking at the documentation or checking the error at runtime. But isn't this against Swift's nature? Swift has powerful generics and a type system to make the code expressive, yet it feels as if throws is exactly opposite because you cannot get anything about the error from looking at the function signature. Why is that so? Or have I missed something important and mistook the concept?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The choice is a deliberate design decision. They did not want the situation where you don't need to declare exception throwing as in Objective-C, C++ and C# because that makes callers have to either assume all functions throw exceptions and include boilerplate to handle exceptions that might not happen, or to just ignore the possibility of exceptions. Neither of these are ideal and the second makes exceptions unusable except for the case when you want to terminate the program because you can't guarantee that every function in the call stack has correctly deallocated resources when the stack is unwound. The other extreme is the idea you have advocated and that each type of exception thrown can be declared. Unfortunately, people seem to object to the consequence of this which is that you have large numbers of catch blocks so you can handle each type of exception. So, for instance, in Java, they will throw Exception reducing the situation to the same as we have in Swift or worse, they use unchecked exceptions so you can ignore the problem altogether. The GSON library is an example of the latter approach. We chose to use unchecked exceptions to indicate a parsing failure. This is primarily done because usually the client can not recover from bad input, and hence forcing them to catch a checked exception results in sloppy code in the catch() block. https://github.com/google/gson/blob/master/GsonDesignDocument.md That is an egregiously bad decision. ""Hi, you can't be trusted to do your own error handling, so your application should crash instead"". Personally, I think Swift gets the balance about right. You have to handle errors, but you don't have to write reams of catch statements to do it. If they went any further, people would find ways to subvert the mechanism. The full rationale for the design decision is at https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/ErrorHandlingRationale.rst EDIT There seems to be some people having problems with some of the things I have said. So here is an explanation. There are two broad categories of reasons why a program might throw an exception. unexpected conditions in the environment external to the program such as an IO error on a file or malformed data. These are errors that the application can usually handle, for example by reporting the error to the user and allowing them to choose a different course of action. Errors in programming such as null pointer or array bound errors. The proper way to fix these is for the programmer to make a code change. The second type of error should not, in general be caught, because they indicate a false assumption about the environment that could mean the program's data is corrupt. There my be no way to continue safely, so you have to abort. The first type of error usually can be recovered, but in order to recover safely, every stack frame has to be unwound correctly which means that the function corresponding to each stack frame must be aware that the functions it calls may throw an exception and take steps to ensure that everything gets cleaned up consistently if an exception is thrown, with, for example, a finally block or equivalent. If the compiler doesn't provide support for telling the programmer they have forgotten to plan for exceptions, the programmer won't always plan for exceptions and will write code that leaks resources or leaves data in an inconsistent state. The reason why the gson attitude is so appalling is because they are saying you can't recover from a parse error (actually, worse, they are telling you that you lack the skills to recover from a parse error). That is a ridiculous thing to assert, people attempt to parse invalid JSON files all the time. Is it a good thing that my program crashes if somebody selects an XML file by mistake? No isn't. It should report the problem and ask them to select a different file. And the gson thing was, by the way, just an example of why using unchecked exceptions for errors you can recover from is bad. If I do want to recover from somebody selecting an XML file, I need to catch Java runtime exceptions, but which ones? Well I could look in the Gson docs to find out, assuming they are correct and up to date. If they had gone with checked exceptions, the API would tell me which exceptions to expect and the compiler would tell me if I don't handle them.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/40718542', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1012793/']}",jdg_311402

Question:
As per the title, I am getting the following error message when implementing Material UI with React. React Hook ""useStyles"" is called in function ""appBar"" which is neither a React function component or a custom React Hook function I have reviewed the rules of hooks ( https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html ) and I am not sure what I have missed. Any assistance rendered would be appreciated. Here is my source code: import React from 'react';import { createStyles, makeStyles, Theme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';import AppBar from '@material-ui/core/AppBar';import Toolbar from '@material-ui/core/Toolbar';import Typography from '@material-ui/core/Typography';import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';import IconButton from '@material-ui/core/IconButton';import MenuIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Menu';const useStyles = makeStyles((theme: Theme) =>  createStyles({    root: {      flexGrow: 1,    },    menuButton: {      marginRight: theme.spacing(2),    },    title: {      flexGrow: 1,    },  }),);export default function appBar() {  const classes = useStyles();  return (    <div className={classes.root}>      <AppBar position=""static"">        <Toolbar>          <IconButton edge=""start"" className={classes.menuButton} color=""inherit"" aria-label=""menu"">            <MenuIcon />          </IconButton>          <Typography variant=""h6"" className={classes.title}>            News          </Typography>          <Button color=""inherit"">Login</Button>        </Toolbar>      </AppBar>    </div>  );}

Question:
Supposing $M$ is a composite number and supposing $a$ is an integer such that $a^{-1}\mod M$ exists,  can we compute $a^{-1} \bmod M$ by using $O(\log^{b}(M))$ ring operations in the RAM model, where $b>0$ and is some fixed number? I'm interested in the case where $a$ and $M$ are of similar sizes. When we apply the Euclidean algorithm, we compute the remainder of an integer divided by another. It is not clear to me if this can be done in unit time in the RAM model using only ring operations.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Let us call the function which takes $(a,b)$ to $r$ such that $a = bq + r$ with $r < b$ (and all of $a,b,q,r$ nonnegative integers) the Remainder function. This function cannot be computed at all using only ring operations in the integers: any function that can be computed using only ring operations is a polynomial of its inputs, so if the Remainder function could be computed using only ring operations, it would follow that $Remainder(a,b) = f(a,b)$ for some integer polynomial $f$. For any fixed $b > 1$, the function $g(x) = f(x,b)$ would then be a univariate polynomial. Now, $g(b+1) = 1$, so $g(x)$ is not identically zero; but $g(x) = 0$ whenever $b | x$, so $g(x)$ has infinitely many zeroes, a contradiction. However, if you allow $<$ in addition to ring operations, then the Remainder function can be computed in polynomially many steps (in the number of bits of the input) as follows: start with $q=1$ and check if $qb > a$ (if so, then the remainder is just $a$). Otherwise, multiply $q$ by $2$ repeatedly until $qb > a$. Then do binary search on $q$ to find $q$ such that $qb \leq a$ and $(q+1)b > a$, and finally output $a - bq$. This takes $O(\log (a/b))$ ring operations and comparisons; on most standard Boolean models of computation each such operation can be done in nearly $O(\log a)$ time.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/25561', 'https://cstheory.stackexchange.com', 'https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/1812/']}",jdg_201035

","The overarching difference here is that the first version is branchless . 16 isn’t the length of any string here (the longer one, with NUL, is only 15 bytes long); it’s an offset into the return object (whose address is passed in RDI to support RVO), used to indicate that the small-string optimization is in use (note the lack of allocation).  The lengths are 5 or 5+1+8 stored in R14, which is stored in the std::string as well as passed to memcpy (along with a pointer chosen by CMOVNE) to load the actual string bytes. The other version has an obvious branch (although part of the std::string construction has been hoisted above it) and actually does have 5 and 14 explicitly, but is obfuscated by the fact that the string bytes have been included as immediate values (expressed as integers) of various sizes. As for why these three equivalent functions produce two different versions of the generated code, all I can offer is that optimizers are iterative and heuristic algorithms; they don’t reliably find the same “best” assembly independently of their starting point.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/63327288', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/9466925/']}",jdg_96494

Question:
I have two classes A and B. Many B's can have association with a single A, hence a many-to-one relationship from B to A. I've mapped the relationship like: <class name=""A"" table=""tbl_A"">  <property name=""propA"" column=""colA""/></class><class name=""B"" table=""tbl_B"">  <property name=""propB"" column=""colB""/>  <many-to-one name=""a"" class=""A"" column=""col1"" cascade=""delete""/></class> A has nothing mapped to B. Keeping this in mind we intend to delete B when it's associated A is deleted. This could have been possible if I could define an inverse=""true"" on the many-to-one association in B but hibernate does not allow that. Can anyone help with this? We do not want to write anything in A for this.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Hibernate only cascades along the defined associations. If A knows nothing about Bs, nothing you do with A will affect Bs. Pascal's suggestion is, therefore, the easiest way to do what you want: <class name=""A"" table=""tbl_A"">  ...  <set name=""myBs"" inverse=""true"" cascade=""all,delete-orphan"">    <key column=""col1""/>    <one-to-many class=""B""/>  </set></class><class name=""B"" table=""tbl_B"">  ...  <many-to-one name=""a"" class=""A"" column=""col1"" not-null=""true""/></class> Note that setting cascade=""delete"" on B as you have it in your original code will NOT do what you want - it tells Hibernate to ""delete A if B is deleted"" which is likely to result in constraint violation (if there are any other Bs linked to that A). If you absolutely cannot add a collection of Bs to A (though I can't really think of the circumstances where that'd be the case), your only other alternative is to define cascade delete from A to B at the foreign key level; your Bs will then be deleted when your A is deleted. This is a rather ugly solution, however, because you have to be extremely careful of how you delete A in Hibernate: Session must be flushed prior to deleting A (having pending updates to B may result in an error or A and some Bs being re-inserted behind the scenes) All Bs linked to your A (and since you're not maintaining the relationship from A side that means all Bs) must be evicted from all active sessions and 2nd level cache.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/1715146', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/75214/']}",jdg_158735

Question:
You can use ng-animate with ng-class with the add and remove animations. I'm looking to make one animation in CSS3 but haven't found good examples with ng-class online. So I was wondering if people have good examples they want to share. I am not sure what my final animation will look like, but for the purpose of this example let's say I just want to make the height of the div gradually increase when I add the class myclass . <div ng-class=""{{myclass:scopeVar}}"" ng-animate=""?????""></div>**CSS**.myclass.ng-add{??}.myclass.ng-add-active{??}.myclass.ng-remove{??}.myclass.ng-remove-active{??}

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Animating an ng-class addition or removal using CSS transition has 3 stages. The order of these stages are very important, I almost spent a day figuring out why a simple animation wasn't working due incorrect understanding of the order in which classes are added. Stage 1: classname-add / classname-remove class is added. Unlike what someone might think, this is actually added before the class is added to/removed from the element. This is the stage where we should add the transition property 1 as well as initial state of our animation. Stage 2: classname class is added or removed. This is where you specify the eventual styles of the element. This class often has nothing to do with our animation. Remember that we are animating the addition/removal of this class. This class itself shouldn't even need to be aware that there is an animation taking place around it. Stage 3: classname-add-active / classname-remove-active class is added. This is added after the class is added to/removed from the element. This is the stage where we should specify the final state of our animation. To see this in action, let's create a classic fade-in-out animation shown when an element's selected state changes ( selected class change using ng-class). angular.module('demo', ['ngAnimate'])  .controller('demoCtrl', function($scope) {    $scope.selected = false;    $scope.selectToggle = function() {      $scope.selected = !$scope.selected;    };  }); .item {  width: 50px;  height: 50px;  background: grey;}.item.selected {  /* this is the actual change to the elment   *  which has nothing to do with the animation   */  background-color: dodgerblue;}.item.selected-add,.item.selected-remove {  /* Here we specify the transition property and   * initial state of the animation, which is hidden    * state having 0 opacity   */  opacity: 0;  transition: opacity 3s;}.item.selected-add-active,.item.selected-remove-active {  /* Here we specify the final state of the animation,   * which is visible having 1 opacity   */  opacity: 1;} <script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.7/angular.js""></script><script src=""https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/angular.js/1.5.7/angular-animate.js""></script><div ng-app=""demo"" ng-controller=""demoCtrl"">  <div class=""item"" ng-class=""{selected:selected}""></div>  <br>  <br>  <button ng-click=""selectToggle();"">    {{selected? 'Unselect' : 'Select'}}  </button></div> 1 Why should I specify the transition in the first state, instead of just adding it to the class being toggled or a static selector on the element?, you ask. Well to explain this, assume you need a one-directional animation, for example a fade-out animation when a fade-out class is added. If you add transition property on the fade-out class itself, the transition stays on the element even after the animation. Which means when your final state (fade-out-add-active) is removed, the element will slowly fade-in back , so we get a fade-out-fade-in which is not what we wanted.

Question:
Given the following differential equation $$\ddot x + (x^2+\dot x^2-1) \dot x + x = 0$$ find the polar equations of motion in state space. This is for my classical mechanics course, but it seems more mathematics than physics, which is why I am asking this here. I am totally lost. I thought about using a substitution $y = \dot x$ , which results in $$\dot y = (1-x^2)y-y^3$$ which doesn't seem oscillatory.  I also see that it is very similar in form to the van der Pol oscillator, but there are additional terms.  So I am just looking for a hint on how to go about this.  Thanks.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Great question, interesting problem, one of my favorites, wish I could upvote the question more than once! So the equation of interest is $\ddot x+(x^2+\dot x^2-1)\dot x + x=0. \tag{1}$ Well, we want a polar expression for (1).  So we begin by making the two-dimensional, planar aspects of (1) obvious, since polars can't really be applied in any nice way to an equation on the line; this transformation is affected by introducing a new variable $y$, and setting $y = \dot x$, so: $\dot x = y, \tag{2}$ then substituting $y$ from (2) into (1) we obtain $\dot y = - (x^2 + y^2 - 1)y - x. \tag{3}$ Taken together, (2) and (3) form a planar system, often called the phase representation of the equation (1); a point in the $x$-$y$ plane now may be interpreted as a complete state of (1), since it contains all the information needed to determine the ensuing trajectory uniquely, i.e., position and velocity.  We cast (2), (3) in polar form by setting $x = r \cos \theta, \tag{4}$ $y = r \sin \theta, \tag{5}$ from which readily follows $\dot x = \dot r \cos \theta -r \dot \theta \sin \theta, \tag{6}$ $\dot y =\dot r \sin \theta + r\dot \theta \cos \theta. \tag{7}$ We now insert (4)-(7) into (2), (3) and, as the old song says, ""boil that cabbage down"", so to speak, by cooking things on the stove of algebraic manipulation: $\dot r \cos \theta -r \dot \theta \sin \theta = r\sin \theta, \tag{8}$ $\dot r \sin \theta + r\dot \theta \cos \theta = - (r^2 \cos^2 \theta + r^2 \sin^2 \theta - 1) r \sin \theta - r \cos \theta;\tag{9}$ now, as Bob Marley sang, we Stir It Up ; so, pretty baby, we re-write (8), (9) a little bit.  Notice that, in terms of the vector $(\dot r, \dot \theta)^T$ the combinedlefts of these two equations can be written in matrix-vector form, whence we arrive at $\begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta & - r\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & r \cos \theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \dot r \\ \dot \theta \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} r \sin \theta \\ -(r^2 - 1)r \sin \theta -r \cos \theta \end{pmatrix}.  \tag{10}$ Now as long as $r \ne 0$, the matrix on the left-hand side of (10) is nonsingular; indeed its determinant is $r$: $\det \begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta & - r\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & r \cos \theta \end{bmatrix} = r(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta) = r; \tag{11}$ thus it may be simply inverted; indeed, a standard calculation yields $\begin{bmatrix} \cos \theta & - r\sin \theta \\ \sin \theta & r \cos \theta \end{bmatrix}^{-1} = \frac{1}{r} \begin{bmatrix} r\cos \theta &  r\sin \theta \\ -\sin \theta & \cos \theta \end{bmatrix}; \tag{12}$ keep stirring, keep stirring, keep boiling:  multiply (10) by (12) and grind; we obtain $\begin{pmatrix} \dot r \\ \dot \theta \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -r(r^2 - 1) \sin^2 \theta \\ -(r^2 -1)(\cos \theta)(\sin \theta) -1 \end{pmatrix}, \tag{13}$ the equation (1) in polar form may thus be written out in non-vector form as $\dot r = -r(r^2 - 1) \sin^2 \theta, \tag{14}$ $\dot \theta = -(r^2 -1)(\cos \theta)(\sin \theta) -1 = -\frac{1}{2}(r^2 -1)\sin 2 \theta -1. \tag{15}$ There! Cabbage ready!  It is worth noting that (14) implies, as long as $\sin^2 \theta \ne 0$, $r$ increases as long as $0 < r < 1$ and decreases when $r > 1$; when $r = 1$ we have $\dot r = 0, \tag{16}$ and $\dot \theta = -1; \tag{17}$ the circle $r = 1$ is apparently a stable, closed, periodic orbit of period $2\pi$, rotating in the clockwise direction.  In the event $\sin^2 \theta = 0$, we have that $\theta = m\pi$ for some integer $m$; then $\sin 2\theta = 0$ as well, so that from (15) $\dot \theta = -1$; the condition $\dot r = 0$ is thus seen to be an ""instantaneous"" phenomenon; $r$ will continue to increase/decrease along a trajectory except at these particular values of $\theta$, with $r \to 1$.  Properties of solutions near points where $\dot \theta = 0$ may be investigated using (15); I leave such questions to my readers.  Other interesting features of the flow may be derived from examination of (15), (16); but my night job beckons, and so I must bid you all adieu . Hope this helps.

Question:

I tried with dict comprehension but it seems that the inline functions ends defined with the last value of the loop. d = {k, lambda s: s * A[k] for k in range(n)}  # e.g. n = 4 After that all lambda functions created are declared with A[3] instead of A[0], A[1], A[2] and A[3] . What's wrong with this code?

Question:
Let us say we have a regular 52-card well-shuffled deck. We scan through the deck (first to last) till we find an Ace. Then we continue (from that Ace) till we find a 2. Then we scan (from the 2) till we find a 3, and so on. We stop when we find a King. (Suits don't matter.) What is the probability that we can complete this process within one scan of the deck?

Question:
My thorough research on the web provided me with a couple of ideas, but none of them seem to work correctly in my particular use case. Here is what I have: 1) Zebra printer, which uses ZPL as its printing language; 2) A string in javascript which consists of 3 ZPL forms for printing 3 labels. Our system engineer has verified already, that the ZPL syntax is all correct.What I am trying to achieve is to send the string as plain text for the printer to accept it as ZPL instructions to print labels.The best I have come up with so far looks like this: var mywindow = window.open('', 'Printing', 'width=800,height=600');//mywindow.write(""testDirectWrite""); // not workingmywindow.document.open('text/plain');////mywindow.document.write('<html><head><title>Printing</title><meta charset=""ISO-8859-1"">');///*optional stylesheet*/ //mywindow.document.write('<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""main.css"" type=""text/css"" />');////mywindow.document.write('</head><body>');var theDiv = $("".test-printirane-po-usb"");var printContents = theDiv[0].innerText;mywindow.document.write(printContents);////mywindow.document.write('</body></html>');//mywindow.document.close(); // necessary for IE >= 10//mywindow.focus(); // necessary for IE >= 10//mywindow.print();//mywindow.close(); For now (testing purposes), theDiv is the container where i place the ZPL string. Basically, I understood, that the best solution is to open a new popup window, fill it with the ZPL string and call thePopupWindow.print(); The user then selects the zebra printer and hits 'Print'. The problem: it seems like the printer interprets what's being printed as an html page (because of the <html><head></head><body>theZPLString comes here</body></html> tags, that i see, when I inspect the popup in Chrome, for example) and prints the ZPL code as plain text, rather than interpret it and print a label. I suppose I need something like thePopupWindow.write() to avoid writing to the document property of the window, which obviously wraps the string in html code.In order to test it, I use the Generic/Text Only driver and save what's ""printed"" into a .txt file. In Chrome I get an empty file. In Mozilla, when I remove this line: mywindow.document.open('text/plain'); I get the ZPL as characters, one per line. When I add it, I get only a date and time, again one char per line.

Question:
Suppose we have a deck of 40 cards which has, 5 Aces, 6 Kings, 9 Queens, 20 Jacks. A game is played where a contestant will continuously draw cards until they have 5 matching cards (not necessarily in order). The cards are drawn without replacement. I'm trying to find the probability of the contestant getting the five matching cards they get are all Aces (i.e. they have to get this before they get any other five matching cards). Does anyone have any idea on how to approach this?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Suppose a win occurs when the fifth ace is drawn on draw $r+1$ , for $0 \le r \le 16$ .  On the previous draw, the hand must have contained four aces and no more than four of any of the other ranks, and then the contestant must draw an ace on draw $r+1$ . Let's try to find the probability of being in a favorable state on draw $r$ .  There are $\binom{40}{r}$ possible hands of $r$ cards, all of which we assume are equally likely.  We would like to count the number of hands containing exactly four aces and no more than four of any other rank, which we will call a ""favorable hand"".  To do this, we will find the generating function of the number of favorable hands.  Numbering the ranks from ace to jack as $1$ through $4$ , let's say $n_i$ is the initial number of cards in the deck of rank $i$ , for $i=1,2,3,4$ , so $n_1 = 5$ , $n_2=6$ , etc.  If we consider only cards of rank $i$ , then the generating function for the number of hands containing zero to four of those cards is $$\sum_{j=0}^4 \binom{n_i}{j} x^j$$ The generating function for the number of ways to draw exactly four aces is simply $\binom{5}{4}x^4$ ;  so the generating function for the number of favorable hands containing cards of all ranks is $$f(x) = \binom{5}{4}x^4 \prod_{i=2}^4 \sum_{j=0}^4 \binom{n_i}{j} x^j$$ I.e., the coefficient of $x^r$ when $f(x)$ is expanded, which which we will denote by $[x^r]f(x)$ , is the number of hands containing exactly four aces and no more than four of any other rank.  After some computation (I used Mathematica, but a pencil and paper computation should not be difficult), $$f(x) = 5 x^4+175 x^5+2975 x^6+32725 x^7+261800 x^8+ \\ 1544980 x^9+6741525 x^{10}+21960225   x^{11}+53723775 x^{12}+ \\ 96756975 x^{13}+122906250 x^{14}  +102343500   x^{15}+45785250 x^{16}$$ The probability of a favorable hand of $r$ cards is then $$\frac{[x^r]f(x)}{\binom{40}{r}}$$ In order to win on draw $r+1$ the player must have a favorable hand on draw $r$ and then draw an ace on draw $r+1$ , when there is one ace left in the deck and $40-r$ cards total.  So the probability of a win on draw $r+1$ is $$\frac{[x^r]f(x)}{\binom{40}{r}} \cdot \frac{1}{40-r}$$ and the overall probability of winning is $$\sum_{r=0}^{16} \frac{[x^r]f(x)}{\binom{40}{r}} \cdot \frac{1}{40-r} = \boxed{0.00194347}$$ Edit (deleted) Edit to the Edit Prompted by one of the comments, I provided a list of learning resources for people who are new to generating functions and would like to learn about them.

","CSS does not have a click handler.  For this reason it is impossible to do with standard CSS.  You could use something called the checkbox hack, but in my humble opinion, it's a bit clunky and would be awkward to work with inside a navigation menu like your use-case requires.  For this reason I would suggest jQuery or Javascript...  Here is a rather simple solution using jQuery. Basically, we hide the sub-nav from the start using display: none; Then, using jQuery, when "".parent"" is clicked we toggle a class "".visible"" to the sub-nav element (the nested UL) with display: block; which makes it appear.  When clicked again, it disappears as the class is removed. Note that for this to work, every nested <UL> which is a ""sub-nav"" MUST have the .sub-nav class, and it's parent element (the <LI> ) MUST have the .parent class.  Also, since this uses jQuery, you will need to hook up a jQuery library to your site.  You can do this by hosting it yourself and linking it like you normally would, or you can link it from google's library service (recommended). JSFiddle Demo $(document).ready(function() {  $('.parent').click(function() {    $('.sub-nav').toggleClass('visible');  });}); #nav ul.sub-nav {  display: none;}#nav ul.visible {  display: block;} <script src=""https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js""></script><ul id=""nav"">  <li>Home</li>  <li class=""parent"">About    <ul class=""sub-nav"">      <li>Johnny</li>      <li>Julie</li>      <li>Jamie</li>    </ul>  </li>  <li>Contact</li></ul>",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/18786546', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2759006/']}",jdg_316641

Question:
Using Symfony 2.0, I am trying to make it work together with XCache. XCache is properly installed. As for the offitial Symfony documentation, we have this XcacheClassLoader.php that should make it. As for the same documentation, we get this piece of advice: /** * XcacheClassLoader implements a wrapping autoloader cached in Xcache for PHP 5.3. * * It expects an object implementing a findFile method to find the file. This * allows using it as a wrapper around the other loaders of the component (the * ClassLoader and the UniversalClassLoader for instance) but also around any * other autoloader following this convention (the Composer one for instance) * *     $loader = new ClassLoader(); * *     // register classes with namespaces *     $loader->add('Symfony\Component', __DIR__.'/component'); *     $loader->add('Symfony',           __DIR__.'/framework'); * *     $cachedLoader = new XcacheClassLoader('my_prefix', $loader); * *     // activate the cached autoloader *     $cachedLoader->register(); * *     // eventually deactivate the non-cached loader if it was registered previously *     // to be sure to use the cached one. *     $loader->unregister(); * * @author Fabien Potencier <fabien@symfony.com> * @author Kris Wallsmith <kris@symfony.com> * @author Kim Hemsø Rasmussen <kimhemsoe@gmail.com> * * @api */ If I am getting it right, the autoload.php should contain that code. This is what I am doing in autoload.php: Normal loader is declared: $loader = new UniversalClassLoader(); All stuff is done to that $loader, like registerNamespaces, registerPrefixes and all external dependencies are loaded to the $loader : $loader->registerNamespaces(    array(        'Symfony' => array(__DIR__ . '/../vendor/symfony/src',                __DIR__ . '/../vendor/bundles'),        'Sensio' => __DIR__ . '/../vendor/bundles',        'JMS' => __DIR__ . '/../vendor/bundles',        'Doctrine\\Common' => __DIR__. '/../vendor/doctrine-common/lib',        'Doctrine\\DBAL' => __DIR__etc... Once all the ""normal"" stuff is made to the $loader, I declare the $cachedLoader, just as said in the documentation: // register classes with namespaces $loader->add('Symfony\Component', __DIR__.'/component'); $loader->add('Symfony',           __DIR__.'/framework'); $cachedLoader = new XcacheClassLoader('my_prefix', $loader); // activate the cached autoloader $cachedLoader->register(); // eventually deactivate the non-cached loader if it was registered previously // to be sure to use the cached one. $loader->unregister(); Am I getting it right? Well obviously not, because all what I get is a completely blank page in my browser and not even logs are written in case they could give me some clue. Thank you in advance.

","Unless you're doing this as an academic exercise, how about java.util.Arrays.equals(b1, b2) The description: Returns true if the two specified arrays of bytes are equal to one  another. Two arrays are considered equal if both arrays contain the  same number of elements, and all corresponding pairs of elements in  the two arrays are equal. In other words, two arrays are equal if they  contain the same elements in the same order. Also, two array  references are considered equal if both are null. I will admit to this being 'java style' :-) Since you're throwing AssertionErrors, you can remove all of the else's: def assertArray(b1: Array[Byte], b2: Array[Byte]): Unit = {  if (b1 == b2) return;  if (b1 == null || b2 == null) throw new AssertionError(""b1 is null while b2 is not, vice versa"")    if (b1.length != b2.length) throw new AssertionError(""b1.length != b2.length"")  for (i <- b1.indices) {    if (b1(i) != b2(i)) throw new AssertionError(""b1(%d) != b2(%d)"".format(i, i))  }} If, as I suspect, you're actually using this within JUnit tests (hence the assertArray), then you can use a trick which I often do, compare the string representations of the arrays: def assertArray2(b1: Array[Byte], b2: Array[Byte]): Unit = {  assertEquals(toString(b1), toString(b2))}def toString(b: Array[Byte]) = if (b == null) ""null"" else java.util.Arrays.asList(b:_*).toString which will give you the same outcome (an AssertionError), with where the differences are.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/7927404', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/342235/']}",jdg_318473

Question:
I have 100,000 images which are not under my control. Some of these images are excellent in that the image stretches to the boundaries whilst some have excessive amounts of white space. When there is excessive white space it makes the page look terrible and means images on the screen all look like they are different sizes. You can see what I mean here: http://www.fitness-saver.com/uk/shop/mountain-bikes/ What I have been hunting for is a jQuery method of cropping the images and removing the whitespace automatically. 1) The amount of whitespace is different in every image2) The ratios of the images are different3) I want to use javascript rather than pre-processing the images.

","To analyse the blank spaces in an image, the only way I know is to load that image into a canvas : var img = new Image(),    $canvas = $(""<canvas>""), // create an offscreen canvas    canvas = $canvas[0],    context = canvas.getContext(""2d"");img.onload = function () {   context.drawImage(this, 0, 0); // put the image in the canvas   $(""body"").append($canvas);   removeBlanks(this.width, this.height);};// test imageimg.src = 'http://images.productserve.com/preview/1302/218680281.jpg'; Next, use the getImageData() method.

"" security exception. This is not a bug, it is an intended feature. From the specs : The toDataURL(), toDataURLHD(), toBlob(), getImageData(), and  getImageDataHD() methods check the flag and will throw a SecurityError  exception rather than leak cross-origin data. This happens when drawImage() loads files from external domains, which causes the canvas's origin-clean flag to be set to false, preventing further data manipulations. I am afraid you will run into the same problem, but anyway, here is the code. Even if this works on client side, I can imagine how miserable will be performance-wise. So, as Jan said, if you can download the images and pre-process them on the server side, that would be better. Edit: I was curious to see if my code would really crop an image, and indeed it does. You can check it out here It only works for images from your domain, as stated before. You can choose your own image with white background and change the last line: // define here an image from your domainimg.src = 'http://localhost/strawberry2.jpg'; Obviously, you will need to run the code from your domain, not from jsFiddle. Edit2: If you want to crop and scale up to keep the same aspect ratio, then change this var $croppedCanvas = $(""<canvas>"").attr({ width: cropWidth, height: cropHeight });// finally crop the guy$croppedCanvas[0].getContext(""2d"").drawImage(canvas,    cropLeft, cropTop, cropWidth, cropHeight,    0, 0, cropWidth, cropHeight); to var $croppedCanvas = $(""<canvas>"").attr({ width: imgWidth, height: imgHeight });// finally crop the guy$croppedCanvas[0].getContext(""2d"").drawImage(canvas,    cropLeft, cropTop, cropWidth, cropHeight,    0, 0, imgWidth, imgHeight); Edit3: One fast way to crop images on the browser, is to parallelize the workload through the use of Web Workers , as this excellent article explains.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/12175991', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1185445/']}",jdg_210486

I need that, when a process on my local host receives data from 192.168.1.88:80 (e.g. the browser), the data is first changed replacing text-A with text-B , like this: 127.0.0.1:... connects to 192.168.1.88:80 127.0.0.1:... sends to 192.168.1.88:80: GET / 192.168.1.88:80 sends to 127.0.0.1:...: HTTP/1.0 200 OKContent-Type: text/plainSome text-A, some other text That data is somewhat intercepted by the system and passed to a program whose output is: HTTP/1.0 200 OKContent-Type: text/plainSome text-B, some other text the system gives the so changed data to the process handling 127.0.0.1:..., like if it comes from 192.168.1.88:80. Assuming I have a stream-based way to make this changes (using sed for instance), what is the easiest way to pre-process the incoming tcp stream?

","The way I find helpful to think about it is: memory is disk space. RAM is a fast cache. Rather than thinking ""when I'm out of RAM, the system will swap it to disk"", I think ""when I have available RAM, the system will move my on-disk memory into it"". That's backwards from how most people think about it, but I find it helps. RAM is just a performance optimization; the real limit on how much memory you can allocate is available disk space. Of course it is more complicated than that. On 32 bit operating systems every process gets a 2 billion byte user address space . (And the same for the kernel address space, but let's ignore that.) Every page of memory you can access, whether it is in RAM or on disk, has to be in that address space.  You can have more than 2 billion bytes allocated, no problem. But you can only address 2 GB of it at a time. If you have 10 GB allocated, then at least 8GB of it will not be mapped into address space. In that case you have to unmap something else and then map what you want into the address space in order to get at it. Moreover, lots of things need to be in contiguous address space. If you have a 1MB stack, for example, then there needs to be a million contiguous bytes available in the address space. When people ""run out of memory"" they are not running out of RAM; RAM is just a fast cache over the disk. And they are not running out of disk space; there's plenty of that. They're almost always in a situation where there is insufficient contiguous address space to meet the demand. The CLR memory manager does not implement these fancy map-and-unmap strategies for you; basically, you get your 2GB address space and that's it. If you want to do something fancy, say with memory mapped files, that's up to you to write the code to manage the memory yourself.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/6002131', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/752648/']}",jdg_75202

Question:
Being completely inexperienced in clojure, and without any functional programming practice since college, I'm trying to interpret some example code to figure out the clojure syntax. I started by coding several versions of Fibonacci ( https://gist.github.com/pcalcao/ea4176719d778ea3ab9e ), but I still can't say I fully understand the more complex forms. For instance, this: (defn fib_map [n]  (last (take (+ n 1)    (map first (iterate (fn [[a b]] [b (+ a b)]) [0 1]))))) I'm struggling to really understand the innermost part of this code: fn [[a b]] [b (+ a b)] Now, from my understanding, we're creating an anonymous function that receives one parameter, a vector with two values (this is destructuring, right?), and returns another vector. Now, what is the reason we would do this, instead of: fn [a b] [b (+ a b)] Are these equivalent? Or are we simply making our anonymous function receive a single parameter as a ""gimmick"" to use in iterate ? Sorry if this is totally obvious, but like I said, Lisp-like languages aren't my strong point yet.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You already figured it out correctly yourself. Function of the form (fn [[a b]] ...) is using destructuring. It takes a single parameter that should be a vector or another type of object that supports clojure's nth function. Using destructuring, it ""pulls"" the first two values out of the vector and assigns them to local variables a and b . Function of the form (fn [a b] ...) is a function of two parameters. The two are not equivalent. The reason you have to use the (fn [[a b]] ...) form with iterate is that iterate only works with single-parameter functions.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/15272403', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/432806/']}",jdg_83471

Question:
If I use the following openssl req -x509  -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.pem -out public.pem -nodes I get private.pem and public.pem If I use ssh-keygen -t rsa -f rsa I get rsa and rsa.pub Is it possible to convert from the format of rsa to private.pem and vice-a-versa? Edit:  To be more specific, a) If I have the private.pem and public.pem generated by the above command, how do I get the equivalent rsa private key and public key? b)  Given the rsa and rsa.pub , how do I get the x509 keys if I do know the additional metadata that the above openssl command takes in? If I go from the openssh format to x509 and back, I should ideally get the same key file back.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You are missing a bit here. ssh-keygen can be used to convert public keys from SSH formats in to PEM formats suitable for OpenSSL. Private keys are normally already stored in a PEM format suitable for both. However, the OpenSSL command you show generates a self-signed certificate . This certificate is not something OpenSSH traditionally uses for anything - and it definitely is not the same thing as a public key only. OpenSSH does have support for certificates as well, but it is likely that you are not using this support. Also, these certificates are not X.509, so they are incompatible with OpenSSL. The certificate contains information that is not present anywhere else and each certificate is unique and can not be recreated at will. This means that you need to store the X.509 certificate, in addition to the private key, if you wish use the same key for both OpenSSL and OpenSSH. If you just want to share the private key, the OpenSSL key generated by your example command is stored in private.pem , and it should already be in PEM format compatible with (recent) OpenSSH. To extract an OpenSSH compatible public key from it, you can just run: ssh-keygen -f private.pem -y > private.pub If you want to start from OpenSSH and work your way over to the OpenSSL side, with a self-signed certificate (for whatever reason), here's how: $ ssh-keygen -f test-userGenerating public/private rsa key pair.Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has been saved in test-user.Your public key has been saved in test-user.pub.The key fingerprint is:ff:36:f1:74:c7:0d:4e:da:79:5c:96:27:2c:2c:4e:b6 naked@tinkThe key's randomart image is:+--[ RSA 2048]----+|                 ||                 ||           . .  .||          + o =.+||        S+ o * B+||         .E o = B||          .  + o.||           .o .  ||           ...   |+-----------------+$ openssl req -x509 -days 365 -new -key test-user -out test-user-cert.pemYou are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporatedinto your certificate request.What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blankFor some fields there will be a default value,If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.-----Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Locality Name (eg, city) []:Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Email Address []:$ ls -l test-user*-rw------- 1 naked naked 1675 Mar 18 21:52 test-user-rw-r--r-- 1 naked naked 1229 Mar 18 21:53 test-user-cert.pem-rw-r--r-- 1 naked naked  392 Mar 18 21:52 test-user.pub From these, both test-user and test-user-cert.pem files are critical to preserve, where as test-user.pub can always be recreated from test-user as needed.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/32768', 'https://security.stackexchange.com', 'https://security.stackexchange.com/users/22142/']}",jdg_130099

Question:
In the structures I have encountered so far, I have always seen a zero, which is usually defined as the additive identity. For example: $\exists 0 \in \mathbb{Z}$ s.t. $\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}, a + 0 = 0+a = a$ It just so happens to be that whenever the need arose, $0$ also served as the multiplicative annihilator, i.e. where $X$ is some commutative ring: $\forall a \in X, a \cdot 0 = 0$, as proven below: $0=0$, so $0+0 = 0$, so $a\cdot(0+0) = a \cdot 0$, so $a\cdot 0 + a \cdot 0 = a \cdot 0$, so $0 = a \cdot 0$. My question is whether the zero always serves as the multiplicative annihilator as well, whether this is actually part of its definition (or an always-implicit corollary), or if it is possible to have a zero that does not serve as a multiplicative annihilator.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It is clear from the OP's argument: $0a = (0 + 0)a = 0a + 0a \Rightarrow 0a = 0 \tag{1}$ that $0$ being a multiplicative annihilator depends on two things:  i.)  the fact that zero is the identity element for the ""$+$"" operation; and (ii.)  the fact that multiplication distributes over addition in the sense that $a(b + c) = a(b + c)$.  So, if you want the zero element to not be a multiplicative annihilator, you'll have to bust one of these postulates.  Well, busting the additive identity won't work and leave us with an Abelian group under ""$+$""; thus we'd have to let go of distributivity, the axiom which ties addition and multiplication together.  If that postulate is eliminated or severely altered, all I can say is: We'll be left with something VERY un-ring like! So, as long as we want rings to be rings , as it were, we have to accept $0$ as multiplicative annihilator that it is. Hope this helps.

The following code is roughly equivalent: static void UsingLambda() {    Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>> lambda = l => l.Where(i => i % 2 == 0).Where(i => i > 5);    var t0 = DateTime.Now.Ticks;    for (int j = 1; j < MAX; j++)         var sss = lambda(x).ToList();    var tn = DateTime.Now.Ticks;    Console.WriteLine(""Using lambda: {0}"", tn - t0);} But I want to build the expression on-the-fly, so here's a new test: static void UsingCompiledExpression() {    var f1 = (Expression<Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>>>)(l => l.Where(i => i % 2 == 0));    var f2 = (Expression<Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>>>)(l => l.Where(i => i > 5));    var argX = Expression.Parameter(typeof(IEnumerable<int>), ""x"");    var f3 = Expression.Invoke(f2, Expression.Invoke(f1, argX));    var f = Expression.Lambda<Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>>>(f3, argX);    var c3 = f.Compile();    var t0 = DateTime.Now.Ticks;    for (int j = 1; j < MAX; j++)         var sss = c3(x).ToList();    var tn = DateTime.Now.Ticks;    Console.WriteLine(""Using lambda compiled: {0}"", tn - t0);} Of course it isn't exactly like the above, so to be fair, I modify the first one slightly: static void UsingLambdaCombined() {    Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>> f1 = l => l.Where(i => i % 2 == 0);    Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>> f2 = l => l.Where(i => i > 5);    Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>> lambdaCombined = l => f2(f1(l));    var t0 = DateTime.Now.Ticks;    for (int j = 1; j < MAX; j++)         var sss = lambdaCombined(x).ToList();    var tn = DateTime.Now.Ticks;    Console.WriteLine(""Using lambda combined: {0}"", tn - t0);} Now comes the results for MAX = 100000, VS2008, debugging ON: Using lambda compiled: 23437500Using lambda:           1250000Using lambda combined:  1406250 And with debugging OFF: Using lambda compiled: 21718750Using lambda:            937500Using lambda combined:  1093750 Surprise . The compiled expression is roughly 17x slower than the other alternatives. Now here comes the questions: Am I comparing non-equivalent expressions? Is there a mechanism to make .NET ""optimize"" the compiled expression? How do I express the same chain call l.Where(i => i % 2 == 0).Where(i => i > 5); programatically? Some more statistics.

Here's a proof of concept: static void UsingCompiledExpressionWithMethodCall() {        var where = typeof(Enumerable).GetMember(""Where"").First() as System.Reflection.MethodInfo;        where = where.MakeGenericMethod(typeof(int));        var l = Expression.Parameter(typeof(IEnumerable<int>), ""l"");        var arg0 = Expression.Parameter(typeof(int), ""i"");        var lambda0 = Expression.Lambda<Func<int, bool>>(            Expression.Equal(Expression.Modulo(arg0, Expression.Constant(2)),                             Expression.Constant(0)), arg0).Compile();        var c1 = Expression.Call(where, l, Expression.Constant(lambda0));        var arg1 = Expression.Parameter(typeof(int), ""i"");        var lambda1 = Expression.Lambda<Func<int, bool>>(Expression.GreaterThan(arg1, Expression.Constant(5)), arg1).Compile();        var c2 = Expression.Call(where, c1, Expression.Constant(lambda1));        var f = Expression.Lambda<Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>>>(c2, l);        var c3 = f.Compile();        var t0 = DateTime.Now.Ticks;        for (int j = 1; j < MAX; j++)        {            var sss = c3(x).ToList();        }        var tn = DateTime.Now.Ticks;        Console.WriteLine(""Using lambda compiled with MethodCall: {0}"", tn - t0);    } And now the timings are: Using lambda:                            625020Using lambda compiled:                 14687970Using lambda combined:                   468765Using lambda compiled with MethodCall:   468765 Woot! Not only it is fast, it is faster than the native lambda. ( Scratch head ). Of course the above code is simply too painful to write. Let's do some simple magic: static void UsingCompiledConstantExpressions() {    var f1 = (Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>>)(l => l.Where(i => i % 2 == 0));    var f2 = (Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>>)(l => l.Where(i => i > 5));    var argX = Expression.Parameter(typeof(IEnumerable<int>), ""x"");    var f3 = Expression.Invoke(Expression.Constant(f2), Expression.Invoke(Expression.Constant(f1), argX));    var f = Expression.Lambda<Func<IEnumerable<int>, IEnumerable<int>>>(f3, argX);    var c3 = f.Compile();    var t0 = DateTime.Now.Ticks;    for (int j = 1; j < MAX; j++) {        var sss = c3(x).ToList();    }    var tn = DateTime.Now.Ticks;    Console.WriteLine(""Using lambda compiled constant: {0}"", tn - t0);} And some timings, VS2010, Optimizations ON, Debugging OFF: Using lambda:                            781260Using lambda compiled:                 14687970Using lambda combined:                   468756Using lambda compiled with MethodCall:   468756Using lambda compiled constant:          468756 Now you could argue that I'm not generating the whole expression dynamically; just the chaining invocations. But in the above example I generate the whole expression. And the timings match. This is just a shortcut to write less code. From my understanding, what is going on is that the .Compile() method does not propagate the compilations to inner lambdas, and thus the constant invocation of CreateDelegate . But to truly understand this, I would love to have a .NET guru comment a little about the internal stuff going on.

Question:
Below is a problem from the book ""Calculus and Analytic Geometry"" by Thomas Finney. I am hoping somebody can check my work. I consider it to be a particular hard problem.Thanks, Bob Problem: We dare you to evaluate this integral. $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4) ... (x+m)} \,\, dx $$ Answer: To evaluate this integral, we will consider some special cases. For $m = 0$ we have: \begin{align*} \int \frac{1}{x} \,\, dx &= \ln|x| + C \\\end{align*} Now for $m = 1$ we have the following integral: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)} \,\, dx $$ \begin{align*}\frac{1}{x(x+1)} &= \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x+1} \\1 &= A(x+1) + B(x) \\\end{align*} At $x = 0$ we have $1 = A(0+1)$ which yields $A = 1$ . \begin{align*}A + B &=  0 \\1 + B &= 0 \\B &= -1 \\\frac{1}{x(x+1)} &= \frac{1}{x} - \frac{1}{x+1}  \\\int \frac{1}{x(x+1)} \,\, dx &=  \ln|x| -  \ln|x+1| + C \\\end{align*} Now for $m = 2$ we have the following integral: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)} \,\, dx $$ \begin{align*}\frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)} &= \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x+1} + \frac{C}{x+2} \\1 &= A(x+1)(x+2) + B(x)(x+2) + C(x)(x+1) \\\end{align*} At $x = 0$ we have $1 = A(0+1)(0+2)$ which yields $A = \frac{1}{2}$ . At $x = -1$ we have $1 = B(-1)(-1+2) = -B$ which yields $B = -1$ . At $x = -2$ we have $1 = C(-2)(-2+1) = 2C$ which yields $C = \frac{1}{2}$ . \begin{align*}\frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)} &= \frac{ \frac{1}{2}}{x} - \frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{ \frac{1}{2}}{x+2} \\\int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)} \,\, dx &= \frac{1}{2} \ln{|x|} - \ln{|x+1|} + \frac{1}{2} \ln{|x+2|} + C \\\end{align*} Now for $m = 3$ we have the following integral: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)} \,\, dx $$ \begin{align*}\frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)} &= \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x+1} + \frac{C}{x+2} + \frac{D}{x+3} \\1 &= A(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) + B(x)(x+2)(x+3) + \\ & C(x)(x+1)(x+3) + D(x)(x+1)(x+2) \\\end{align*} At $x = 0$ we have $1 = A(0+1)(0+2)(0+3) = 6A$ which yields $A = 1/6$ . At $x = -1$ we have $1 = B(-1)(-1+2)(-1+3) = -2B$ which yields $B = -1/2$ . At $x = -2$ we have $1 = C(-2)(-2+1)(-2+3) = 2C$ which yields $C = 1/2$ . At $x = -3$ we have $1 = D(-3)(-3+1)(-3+2) = -6D$ which yields $D = -1/6$ . Hence, we have the following solution: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)} \,\, dx =\frac{1}{6}\ln{|x|} - \frac{1}{2}\ln{|x+1|} + \frac{1}{2}\ln{|x+2|} - \frac{1}{6}\ln{|x+3|} + C $$ Now for $m = 4$ we have the following integral: $$ \int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)} \,\, dx $$ \begin{align*}\frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)} &= \frac{A}{x} + \frac{B}{x+1} + \frac{C}{x+2} + \frac{D}{x+3} + \frac{E}{x+4} \\1 &= A(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4) \\  &+ B(x)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4) \\  &+ C(x)(x+1)(x+3)(x+4) \\  &+ D(x)(x+1)(x+2)(x+4)  \\  &+ E(x)(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) \\\end{align*} At $x = 0$ we have $1 = A(0+1)(0+2)(0+3)(0+4) = 24A$ which yields $A = 1/24$ . At $x = -1$ we have $1 = B(-1)(-1+2)(-1+3)(-1+4) = -6B$ which yields $B=-1/6$ . At $x = -2$ we have $1 = C(-2)(-2+1)(-2+3)(-2+4) = 4C$ which yields $C = 1/4$ . At $x = -3$ we have $1 = D(-3)(-3+1)(-3+2)(-3+4) = -6D$ which yields $D=-1/6$ . At $x = -4$ we have $1 = E(-4)(-4+1)(-4+2)(-4+3) = 24E$ which yields $E=1/24$ . Hence we have the solution: Now for $m = 4$ we have the following integral: $$\int \frac{1}{x(x+1)(x+2)(x+3)(x+4)} \,\, dx = \frac{\ln{|x|} - 4\ln{|x+1|} + 6\ln{|x+2|} - 4\ln{|x+3|} + \ln{|x+4|}}{24} + C $$ Now let's consider the general case. \begin{align*}\frac{1}{x(x+1) \cdots (x+m)} \,\, &= \frac{C_0}{x} + \frac{C_1}{x+1} \cdots + \frac{C_m}{x+m} \\ \end{align*} \begin{align*}1 &= {C_0}(x+1)(x+2) \cdots (x+m) \\  &+ {C_1}(x)(x+2) \cdots (x+m) \\  &+ {C_2}(x)(x+1)(x+3)(x+4) \cdots (x+m) \\  &+ \cdots \\  &+ C_m(x)(x+1)(x+2) \cdots (x+m-1) \\\end{align*} Now let's consider the first term. We set $x = 0$ and we get: \begin{align*}1 &= {C_0}(0+1)(0+2) \cdots (x+m) = m! C_0 \\C_0 &= \frac{1}{m!}\end{align*} Now let's consider the $C_2$ term. We set $x = 2$ and $m > 4$ . We get: \begin{align*}1 &= C_2(-2)(-2+1)(-2+3)(-2+4)(-2 + 5) \cdots (-2 + m) \\1 &= C_2 (2)(1)(2)(3)(4) \cdots (m-2) \\1 &= 2(m-2)! C_2 \\C_2 &= \frac{1}{2(m-2)!} = \frac{m(m-1)}{2(m!)} \\C_2 &= \frac{ \binom {m}{2} } {m!} \\\end{align*} Now let's consider the last term. We set $x = -m$ and we get: \begin{align*}1 &= C_m(-m)(-m+1)(-m+2) \cdots (x+m -1) \\C_m &= \frac{(-1)^{m}}{m!} \\\end{align*} Now let's consider one of the middle terms. We set $x = -k$ where $0 <= k <= m$ and we get: \begin{align*}1 &= C_k(-k)(-k+1)(-k+2) \cdots (-1) (1)(2) \cdots (-k + m - 1) \\ 1 &=  {-1}^k C_k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots  (1)(2) \cdots (-k + m - 1) \\C_k &= \frac{ 1 }{ {(-1)}^k C_k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots  (1)(2) \cdots (-k + m - 1)  } \\C_k &= \frac{ k! }{ {(-1)}^k C_k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots  (1)m!  } \\C_k &= \frac{ \binom {m}{k} }{ {(-1)}^k m!  } \\\end{align*} Hence the answer is: $$ \sum_{k=0}^{k=m} \left( \frac{ \binom {m}{k} }{ {(-1)}^k m!  }\right) \ln{|x+k|} + C $$

","At this line: ""Now let's consider the first term. We set $x=0$ and we get:"" $$1 = {C_0}(0+1)(0+2) \cdots (x+m) = m!C_0$$ When you set $x=0$ there won't be any $x$ left. For $C_2$ there is no mistake but then for the general term you did the same typo. You can't have after you set $x=-m$ : $$1 = C_m(-m)(-m+1)(-m+2) \cdots (\color{red}x+m -1)$$ And for the last part for some reason, you have $C_k$ in the denominator. $$\begin{align*}1 &= C_k(-k)(-k+1)(-k+2) \cdots (-1) (1)(2) \cdots (-k + m - 1) \\ 1 &=  (-1)^k C_k(k-1)(k-2) \cdots  (1)(2) \cdots (-k + m - 1) \\C_k &= \frac{ 1 }{ (-1)^k \color{red}{C_k}(k-1)(k-2) \cdots  (1)(2) \cdots (-k + m - 1)  } \\C_k &= \frac{ k! }{ (-1)^k \color{red}{C_k}(k-1)(k-2) \cdots  (1)m!  } \\C_k &= \frac{ \binom {m}{k} }{ (-1)^k m!  } \\\end{align*}$$ Other than this everything it's correct.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3232158', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/154155/']}",jdg_357443

Question:
This may sound naive, but are there any data structures / algorithms that cannot be constructed in C, given enough code?  I understand the argument of being Turing complete.  I also know it's beneficial to have an elegant solution and that time complexity is important (i.e. more expressive or succinct when implemented in Ruby / Java / C# / Haskell / Lisp).  All the languages I've researched or used all seem to have been created or subsequently refactored into C based compilers, interpreters, and/or virtual machines.  Are some complex data structures only implementable with an interpreter and/or virtual machine?  If that virtual machine or interpreter is C based, isn't that just another data structure abstraction of the underlying C code?  i.e. C has a simple type system but serves as the foundation for a dynamic type system.  I was surprised to learn metaprogramming seems possible in C using the preprocessor ( ioccc.org Immanuel Herrmann ).  I've also seen some intriguing C algorithms that mimic the concurrency model of Erlang, but don't recall the source. What inspired this question was the StackOverflow post ( Lesser Known Useful Data Structures ) and the Patrick Dussud interview on channel9 ( Garbage Collection - Past, Present and Future ) - explaining how they wrote the the first CLR garbage collector (written in Lisp targeting the JVM, compiled from Lisp to C++ for the CLR). So, at the end of the day, after I finish punching my cards, I'm wondering if this question is probably more about C programming language design than convenience of programming and time complexity.  For example, I could implement a highly complex algorithm in Prolog that is very elegant and quite difficult to understand expressed any other way, but I'm still limited by the assembly instructions and the computer architecture (on/off) at the other end of the stick, so I'd be here all night.

","Shor's algorithm for factorizing integers in O((log n)^3) polynomial time cannot be implemented in C, because the computers that it can run on do not yet officially exist. Maybe someday there will be a quantum circuit complete version of C and I'll have to revise my answer. Joking aside, I don't think anybody can give you a satisfying answer to this. I will try to cover some aspects: Vanilla, standard C might not be able to make use of the whole feature set of your processor. For example, you are not able to use the TSX feature of recent Intel processors explicitly. You can of course resort to OS primitives, inline assembly, language extensions or third-party libraries to circumvent that. C by itself is not very good at parallel/asynchronous/concurrent/distributed programming. Some examples of languages that probably make a lot of tasks infinitely easier in this area are Haskell (maybe Data Parallel Haskell soon?), Erlang, etc. that provide very fast and lightweight threads/processes and async I/O. Working with green threads and heavily asynchronous I/O in C is probably less pleasant, although I'm sure it can be done. In the end, on the user level side of things, of course you can emulate every Turing complete language with any other, as you pointed out so correctly.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/21396215', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2712028/']}",jdg_225797

Question:
I've got a Django app serving a webpage with an HTML5  element. There's a wierd ""feature"", turning the video element to be non-seekable: video.seekable returns a timeRanges object with length=0 , whereas it should be length=1 . This means I can't edit the video. JavaScript can't do anything either. The thing is, when I upload the problematic webpage, statically - no Django, just plain HTML/JS/CSS - to my website for testing, it works fine - length=1 . However, if I try to serve the same static page on my Django dev server still gives the same problem. I am using Django's static serving for dev/debug purposes - Do you have any idea what is causing this, or how can I fix it? Thanks.

","Django's dev server probably doesn't support HTTP byte ranges, which is what browsers usually use to implement seeking. Any production web server, e.g. Apache, lighttpd, or nginx, should support these fine. If you can run your entire Django app one of these servers the problem should go away. A workaround would be to just serve the video from a server like that: set one of them up to statically serve the video directory on your machine on a different port than Django's dev server, and then in your dev environment either change the <video src= URL to point to the new web server, or write a special view for videos that redirects to the new web server.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/4538810', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/207894/']}",jdg_110591

Below is a question asked on the forum mathematica.stackexchange.com. Provide a good and informational response to it like a helpful human would.

Question:
I am now struggling to understand code that contains the following (simplified) Manipulate structure. Manipulate[    complexparts[E^(I Pi t)], {{t, 1/4.}, 0., 2}, {{complexparts, {Re[#], Im[#]} &}, None}] I am having difficulty with the last line: {{complexparts, {Re[#], Im[#]}&}, None} . Somehow, this creates a ""pure function"" with a name ""complexparts,"" which is then used above in the line complexparts[E^(I Pi t)] I tried to execute these independently outside the body of code so I could watch them do what they do, but without success. I evaluated: {{complexparts, {Re[#], Im[#]} &}, None} and then: complexparts[x+Iy] But my output was just: complexparts(x+I y) Can I get some help in understanding how {{complexparts, {Re[#], Im[#]} &}, None} works? And what does the word None do?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","What the first part of the variable declaration does Manipulate initializes complexparts to {Re[#], Im[#]} & when it executes.  (In general, a declaration of the form {{var, expr},...} in a Manipulate results in the local variable var being initialized to expr .)  To use complexparts outside of the Manipulate , do this: complexparts = {Re[#], Im[#]} &;With[{θ = 0.25, b = 0.5 + 0.2 I}, complexparts /@ {E^(I π θ), b E^(-I π θ),    E^(I π θ) + b E^(-I π θ), 0}](* {{0.707107, 0.707107}, {0.494975, -0.212132}, {1.20208, 0.494975}, {0, 0}} *) Addendum 1 -- What ""None"" does To illustrate @Mr.Wizard's remark about Initialization , one could modify @David's code above as follows: Manipulate[ complexparts[E^(I Pi t)], {{t, 1/4.}, 0., 2}, {complexparts, None}, Initialization :> (complexparts = {Re[#], Im[#]} &)] The declaration {complexparts, None} declares complexparts to be a local variable of the DynamicModule that is created by the Manipulate command.  Whether complexparts needs to be declared local or not doesn't seem important in such an example.  Generally I try to localize variables whenever possible, especially in Manipulate , as it saves headaches if you're doing scratch work in the same kernel that the Manipulate uses.  Since the intended scope of complexparts is entire body of the Manipulate (and furthermore, it never changes), declaring it as a variable in a Manipulate seems appropriate.  It hardly matters here, but in some cases it can make a big difference. Update -- Reference to the manual I have found a passage in the manual which I believe documents the usage of None .  There are two alternatives for specifying a control type {u, ..., ControlType -> type} or more briefly (u, ..., type} This last one is not described but is used frequently in the examples.  Technically it has the form {u, ..., func} where func is a function that constructs the control; however, since None is not a function, one can object that None must be treated as a special case.  On the other hand, the reference page state Possible control types include: Animator .... None can also be used. The effect of a variable declaration is described thus: Manipulate generates a DynamicModule object, with the variables u, v, etc. specified as local. While the manual does not clearly state that {u,..., None} is accepted usage, it does state that what is practically equivalent, {u,..., ControlType -> None} is: Use ControlType to specify the type of control to use, including None : Manipulate[u, {u, 0, 1}, ControlType -> None] Addendum 2 -- ""None"" and other alternatives In response to the updated title for @David's question, as well as to some of the comments, the following might be worth studying to see the differences. Problem. We need the variable var to be local.  It takes a long time to compute its value.  It won't change its value, but we need to dynamically access the value (or parts of the value). As an example, var is to be a list of squares and the ""long time"" is simulated by Pause[0.2] .  We wish to display part n of var with the slider for n .  The solutions below all do the ""same"" thing.  But there are differences in how each works.  Depending on what one is trying to do, the differences can be significant.  In my opinion, #1 is the best; the others can be fine in appropriate situations.  I'll explain below. (* 1 *)Manipulate[ var[[n]], {n, 1, 10, 1}, {{var, Table[Pause[0.2]; n^2, {n, 10}]}, None}](* 2 *)Manipulate[ var[[n]], {n, 1, 10, 1}, {var, None}, Initialization :> (var = Table[Pause[0.2]; n^2, {n, 10}])](* 3 *)Module[{var = Table[Pause[0.2]; n^2, {n, 10}]}, Manipulate[  var[[n]],  {n, 1, 10, 1}  ]](* 4 *)Manipulate[ Module[{var = Table[Pause[0.2]; n^2, {n, 10}]},  var[[n]]], {n, 1, 10, 1} ] The most important thing to ask is when is var calculated in each solution above: Once when the input cell is first evaluated. Every time the Manipulate output is (re)activated.  For instance, every time the notebook is opened. Once when the input cell is first evaluated. (Same as #1.) Every time n changes value.  This is terrible. The second question is where is var stored: In the output cell (in the notebook) and loaded into the kernel.  Can make a very big notebook file, but the data is persistent. In the output cell l (in the notebook) as in 1 (and overwritten by the Initialization code). Correction due to @unlikely. Just in the kernel, when the input cell is evaluated.  (Note the difference in #1.) In the kernel, after recalculation. Next, does the output work when the notebook is reopened?  Will it work as a CDF?  As a Wolfram Demonstration? (Each has the same answer for a given solution): 1, 2, 4: Yes.3: No.  (Even if var were made global, a Demonstration must have Manipulate as the outside function.) So in summary, Fast, fast on re-open of notebook, quick start-up in a CDF. Fast, slow on re-open, slow start-up in a CDF.  (Change pause to 5 seconds, and you'll see a problem.) Fast, won't work on reopen, won't work in a CDF. Super slow all the time. Now what's going on? In #1, the data is computed first and fed to Manipulate , which stores in the output.  That's what happens in {{var, initial_value},..} . In #2, the Initialization code is stored unevaluated in the output.  Every time the output cell is activated (by opening the notebook and scrolling to the cell), the Initialization code is evaluated. In #3, a local variable is first created in the kernel and initialized; the local id for var is stored in the Manipulate output.  When the notebook is reopened, this id is invalid.  You have to reevaluate the input again to get it to work. In #4, a new local variable is created every time the Manipulate is updated (on start-up and every time a control is moved or a tracked variable changes); the variable is then initialized, so this can cost a lot a time.  When the initialization time is short, you won't really notice the difference between #1, #2, and #4.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/17112', 'https://mathematica.stackexchange.com', 'https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/5183/']}",jdg_248699

Question:
I'm developing a plan/strategy to manage patch deployment on Windows Clients using Windows Server Update Services. What are the some important things to consider in developing this plan? For example, auto-rebooting after an update although may seem trivial, may have considerable impact on some machines. So one solution is, to create a separate patch group in WSUS for machines that shouldn't auto-reboot. Tell me some things to keep in mind when developing a patch management plan and how to solve them. Thanks in advance

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","We stay a month behind (it's a nice round number) and also keep a separate group for machines that shouldn't auto-reboot.  We also make a specific effort to exclude service packs, new versions of IE, and other major upgrades from the patch management system, taking the view that as these constitute a major upgrade you want to be physically there to see it happening, and respond to anything that needs responding to. You should certainly consider having a test group of PCs that are a good representation of what's out there that don't stay a month behind (i.e. get their patches immediately).  That way, if a patch is going to cause trouble at the PC level, you will find out about it quickly enough and can make a call on how to deal with it without every PC being affected. Finally, in WSUS ""update rollups"" is a category separate to ""critical and security updates"", but yet some vital recent patches (Conficker, anyone?) were classified under that heading, so ensure that you don't miss it!",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://serverfault.com/questions/22631', 'https://serverfault.com', 'https://serverfault.com/users/4113/']}",jdg_83035

Question:
I have a list of 500000 randomly generated Tuple<long,long,string> objects on which I am performing a simple ""between"" search: var data = new List<Tuple<long,long,string>>(500000);...var cnt = data.Count(t => t.Item1 <= x && t.Item2 >= x); When I generate my random array and run my search for 100 randomly generated values of x , the searches complete in about four seconds. Knowing of the great wonders that sorting does to searching , however, I decided to sort my data - first by Item1 , then by Item2 , and finally by Item3 - before running my 100 searches. I expected the sorted version to perform a little faster because of branch prediction: my thinking has been that once we get to the point where Item1 == x , all further checks of t.Item1 <= x would predict the branch correctly as ""no take"", speeding up the tail portion of the search. Much to my surprise, the searches took twice as long on a sorted array ! I tried switching around the order in which I ran my experiments, and used different seed for the random number generator, but the effect has been the same: searches in an unsorted array ran nearly twice as fast as the searches in the same array, but sorted!

","When you are using the unsorted list all tuples are accessed in memory-order . They have been allocated consecutively in RAM. CPUs love accessing memory sequentially because they can speculatively request the next cache line so it will always be present when needed. When you are sorting the list you put it into random order because your sort keys are randomly generated. This means that the memory accesses to tuple members are unpredictable. The CPU cannot prefetch memory and almost every access to a tuple is a cache miss. This is a nice example for a specific advantage of GC memory management : data structures which have been allocated together and are used together perform very nicely. They have great locality of reference . The penalty from cache misses outweighs the saved branch prediction penalty in this case. Try switching to a struct -tuple. This will restore performance because no pointer-dereference needs to occur at runtime to access tuple members. Chris Sinclair notes in the comments that ""for TotalCount around 10,000 or less, the sorted version does perform faster "". This is because a small list fits entirely into the CPU cache . The memory accesses might be unpredictable but the target is always in cache. I believe there is still a small penalty because even a load from cache takes some cycles. But that seems not to be a problem because the CPU can juggle multiple outstanding loads , thereby increasing throughput. Whenever the CPU hits a wait for memory it will still speed ahead in the instruction stream to queue as many memory operations as it can. This technique is used to hide latency. This kind of behavior shows how hard it is to predict performance on modern CPUs. The fact that we are only 2x slower when going from sequential to random memory access tell me how much is going on under the covers to hide memory latency. A memory access can stall the CPU for 50-200 cycles. Given that number one could expect the program to become >10x slower when introducing random memory accesses.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 9, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/14023988', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/335858/']}",jdg_136608

","This is one of those things which can be surprisingly tricky to get right. Many people will suggest using float:left; for this. Personally, I really dislike floats; they seem to cause more problems than they solve. My preference is to use inline-block. This is a display method that combines inline properties (so you can easily align elements next to each other, etc) with block properties (such as being able to specify dimensions). So the answer is simply to make them both display:inline-block; and give the prompts a fixed width, which will make the input fields next to them line up. You'll also need some sort of line feed or break after the input field, otherwise the next prompt will appear on the same line, which isn't the desired effect. The best way to achieve this is to put each prompt and its field into a container <div> . So your HTML will look like this: <fieldset id=""o-bs-sum-buginfo"" class=""myfields"">  <div>    <label for=""o-bs-sum-bug-ErrorPrefix"">Error Prefix</label>    <input type=""text"" id=""o-bs-sum-bug-ErrorPrefix"" name=""ErrorPrefix"" value="""" />  </div>  <div>    <label for=""o-bs-sum-bug-ErrorNumber"">Error Number</label>    <input type=""text"" id=""o-bs-sum-bug-ErrorNumber"" name=""ErrorNumber"" value="""" />  </div>  ....</fieldset> and your CSS will look like this: .myfields label, .myfields input {  display:inline-block;}.myfields label {  width:200px; /* or whatever size you want them */} Hope that helps. Edit :you can use this plugin for setting the width of each label: jQuery.fn.autoWidth = function(options) {   var settings = {         limitWidth   : false   }   if(options) {         jQuery.extend(settings, options);     };     var maxWidth = 0;   this.each(function(){         if ($(this).width() > maxWidth){           if(settings.limitWidth && maxWidth >= settings.limitWidth) {             maxWidth = settings.limitWidth;           } else {             maxWidth = $(this).width();           }         }   });     this.width(maxWidth); } from this page in a comment and you use it this way: $(""div.myfields div label"").autoWidth(); and thats all... all your labels are going to take the width of the longest label",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/4641346', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1104241/']}",jdg_309989

Question:
Below are the package versions I'm using. React version - 16.13.1react-router-dom version - 6.0.0-beta.0react-redux version 7.2.0Material UI version 4.11.0 How/what is the best way to check that a form isDirty (has changed) when the user is trying to leave the current page? I would like to prompt ""Are you sure want to leave...."" if the form isDirty . I will fetch the data from within useEffect() and use a redux reducer to render the UI. Should I declare a variable to keep the original fetched data for dirty checking? This is what I am doing, but it is not working correctly. component.js useEffect(() => {    props.fetchUserInfo(); }) action.js export function fetchUserInfo() { return (dispatch) => {     dispatch({type: USER_INITIALSTATE, {Name: 'abc', Age: 20}}      ) }} userReducer.js const initialState = {  processing: false,  success: false,  fail: false,  Profile: {}}let oriState;let State;const UserReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {  if (action.type === USER_INITIALSTATE) {    oriState = {Profile: action.data};    State = {...state, Profile: action.data};    return {...state, Profile: action.data};  } else if (action.type === OTHERS_ACTION) {     //update field change     return {...state, xxx}  }}export const userIsDirty = state => {  if (oriState && State) {    return JSON.stringify(oriState.Profile) !== JSON.stringify(State.Profile);  }  return false;};export default UserReducer; So in my component I call userIsDirty to return the isDirty boolean, but I haven't figured out how to catch the leave page event and use this as a trigger to do the dirty form checking. So how to detect leaving the current page? I tried something on useEffect return(component umount), but the props is not getting the updated INITIALSTATE state (meaning I will get Profile: {}), because it only runs once, but if I add the useEffect optional array argument, I get an infinite loop(maybe I set it wrong?). useEffect(() => {    props.fetchUserInfo();    return () => {      console.log(props); //not getting initial state object    };  }, []); Am I doing this the correct way? What have I missed? Is there a better/correct solution to achieve what I want? Thanks @gdh, useBlocker is the one I want. I am using it to popup a confirmation dialog.

","If ""elementary"" means not using complex numbers, consider this. First minimize the Rayleigh ratio $R(x)=(x^TAx)/(x^Tx).$ The minimum exists and is real.This is your first eigenvalue. Then you repeat the usual proof by induction in dimension of the space. Alternatively you can consider the minimax or maximin problem with the same Rayleigh ratio,(find the minimum of a restriction on a subspace, then maximum over allsubspaces) and it will give you all eigenvalues.

Question:
There are numerous login forms with the little check box ""Remember my password"" so that the next time you visit the website, the browser automatically fills up the password field for you. But I have noticed a behavior in modern browsers, such as Chrome/Firefox, which shows up a notification bar to save the user name/passoword even though that particular web page does not have any ""remember password"" check box. so my questions are: If I have to put the ""remember password"" check box in a login form, what do I have to do when the user checks it? I mean, do I have to store the password in browser cookies (or Local Storage)? If so, should the password be encrypted or plain text? The ""Save password"" notification bar is a browser's functionality or is there any way to invoke it from the web page?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The ""save password"" part comes from the browser's password manager whenever it sees an <input type=""password""> that looks like it really is asking for a password. You can use the autocomplete attribute to suppress this in most browsers: <input type=""password"" name=""password"" autocomplete=""off""> This won't validate but that usually doesn't matter. The ""remember me"" part is completely separate from the browser's password manager. The ""remember me"" flag is the server's business and all it does is fiddle with the expiry date on the cookie that it sends back. The server will always send a cookie back (unless they're not using cookies for tracking sessions but that's rare and wouldn't need a ""remember me"" anyway) with something inside it to identify the client user. If you check ""remember me"" then you're telling the server that you want a persistent session. To achieve this, the server will include an expiry date with the cookie and that expiry date will be some time in the future. When the date arrives, the browser will expire and delete the cookie; without the cookie, the server won't know who you are anymore and you'll have to login again. If you don't check ""remember me"" then you'll get a session cookie. Session cookies don't have expiry dates on them so automatically expire when the browser exits. Session cookies are useful for shared machines. Executive summary: ""Save password"" is from the browser's password manager. ""Remember me"" is about the login cookie's expiry time.

Question:
There have been some discussions of this topic on other metas , and it seemed to me that the consensus is to avoid MathJax in titles if possible, for various reasons like improving the look of the posts in HNQ and other places where MathJax is not enabled, as well as avoiding the interference of MathJax handling of mouse events with behavior of hypelinks. According to this, I've recently edited this question (see revision 7) to convert $HeH^+$ to HeH⁺ . In an hour, a moderator edited the post, (among other changes) bringing MathJax markup back with $\text{HeH}^⁺$ and $\text{H}_2$ items. What is the position of Physics.SE on this? In the context of question titles, is $\text{HeH}^⁺$ and $\text{H}_2$ preferable to HeH⁺ and H₂? Do we ever want to avoid MathJax in the titles?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I would argue that MathJax in titles should be kept to the minimum required, and as readable as possible, but if it is integral to writing a good title for the question then it should very much stay there. In other words, if a title requires explicit mathematics, then those explicit mathematics should stay there. Our site has a bunch of questions that are intrinsically about a very technical subject matter, and attempting to dance around the math by trying to describe it with words often results in a bland pulp of a title that doesn't say anything at all. This should be avoided. However, that said, MathJax in titles does come with a cost. It comes with the cost that it cannot be displayed on other SE sites in the HNQ sidebar, so it wont' be shown there. This is a red herring -- we're not here to optimize for HNQ. The true cost is that it does not render correctly in external search engines. As a reminder, this is what the split for this site's traffic sources looks like: The search-engine pie slice consists of about 96% Google, and about 1% each for Bing, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, with some other tiny sources. The referred traffic is about 35% internal PSE traffic, and the rest of the reported sites are all from other SE sites (read: HNQ). Having lots of unreadable MathJax in the title makes it hard to parse in the linking source for 90% of our traffic. This should not be dismissed. So, those two criteria are in some tension. Since disregarding the first makes for useless titles, however, we should keep the MathJax when it is necessary, but due consideration should be made so that the title is as readable as possible when seen in un-MathJax-ed plain-text form. The question you linked to is a good example: $HeH^+$ ( $HeH^+$ ) is bad MathJax, and should not be used at all. Element names should be typeset in upright script, not italics. HeH⁺ (HeH⁺), with plain unicode, is acceptable, but its formatting will disagree with the other titles on the PSE front page (and other pages that list titles) in a way that's likely to either be noticeable or to be jarring even if not noticed. One should also keep in mind that unicode display is sometimes inconsistent: even if it displays correctly on your device, there's no guarantee that it will show up as you intended on other devices. $\text{HeH}^+$ ( $\text{HeH}^+$ ) is correct MathJax, but it is clunky and makes it hard to read when rendered in plaintext. Instead, I would argue that the correct typesetting to use here is HeH$^+$ (HeH $^+$ ): it is semantically correct and will render correctly when MathJax is turned on, it is much more readable when seen in plain text, the text will render in the same font as the rest of the title, so it will harmonize better with its surroundings. Finally, for full clarity: displayed equations (i.e. the use of double dollar signs, $$ maths $$ , which take up a separate line) is absolutely not appropriate in a question title. Displayed maths take up multiple lines in every place where titles are listed, and doing so amounts to an abusive occupation of space, to the detriment to the other questions in the listing.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/12706', 'https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/users/21441/']}",jdg_94957

Question:
This question was on a math competition. Is there a triangle, which is not equilateral, whose sides form a geometric sequence and whose angles form an arithmetic sequence? If such a triangle exists, find its sides and angles. My attempt: Assume a triangle with sides $a$ , $ar$ and $ar^2$ and its angles $\theta-\phi$ , $\theta$ and $\theta+\phi$ . Now sum of triangles is always $180°$ .So $\theta = 60°$ . Then using the sine law, $\dfrac{\sin(\theta-\phi)}a=\dfrac{\sin\theta}{ar}=\dfrac{\sin(\theta+\phi)}{ar^2}$ Cancelling the a and plugging in the equation the value of $\theta$ , $\dfrac{\sin(60°-\phi)}1=\dfrac{\sin60°}{r}=\dfrac{\sin(60°+\phi)}{r^2}$ This is where I am stuck.

Question:
Lately I got in a discussion with my colleague whether the appsettings.Development.json should be added to the git repository or not. My considerations are: when a developer clones a repository to his development machine and builds the application, he should be able to run the application without any tweaking of the settings. That's what the appsettings.Development.json file is for: providing settings for a Development machine, so the application can be executed, tested (and debugged) locally. However, the questioned appsettings.Development.json contained some absolute paths to files, which is bad because not every developer uses the same directory structure on his machine. So, there is still some tweaking needed before the application can be executed. My colleague uses this as an argument that the appsettings.Development.json should not be added to the git repository and that every developer should create his own appsettings.Development.json file by looking at the appsettings.json and replacing the values in that file as needed. (Both the appsettings.Development.json and the appsettings.json do not contain any security data or passwords; the first one because it has only development settings and the second one only contains tokens that must be replaced during deployment.) On the internet, there was almost nothing to find about this subject. So my question is: should the appsettings.Development.json be in the repository or not?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","when a developer clones a repository to his development machine and builds the application, he should be able to run the application without any tweaking of the settings In an ideal world, it would indeed be the case. Moreover, some open source projects, including very large and complex ones, are exactly like that: you check out the source, you run make , and it works flawlessly. This, however, requires a lot of effort from the maintainers. Such effort makes sense for open source projects, where a lot of persons are checking out the project for the first time. If you don't automate this stage, those new persons will create tickets that will waste maintainers' time, and create an overall feeling that the project is not mature enough. In corporate projects, things are different. You may have a new person joining the team once per year, and it's simply cheaper to just spend half an hour with this person configuring his environment and making the whole thing work. The steps to make it work may be documented, but not necessarily automated. Moreover, some steps cannot be automated easily. If the project relies on, say, the corporate message queue service, and in order to gain access to it, you need to create a ticket for the support team to grant you the permissions, the step is necessarily manual. However, the questioned appsettings.Development.json contained some absolute paths to files, which is bad because not every developer uses the same directory structure on his machine. Or maybe what is bad is the fact that every developer uses different directories. The benefit of a corporate environment is that you can automate the deployment of a new operating system and all the required software to a PC of a new employee. Once you do it, everyone would necessarily have the exact same directory structure. the appsettings.Development.json should not be added to the git repository and that every developer should create his own appsettings.Development.json file by looking at the appsettings.json and replacing the values in that file as needed. When somebody joins the team, it is indeed relatively easy to customize the settings, if things are properly documented. However, once you customized the settings, you should check your changes to the repository, in case you delete the settings file by mistake (or your PC takes fire). One of the possible approaches that I've used for my Python projects is to have a general config.json file containing the recommended settings, and then config.<machine-name>.json file containing the settings specific for a given machine. At runtime, the application checks both files, and deduces the actual settings that need to be used.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/421657', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/367979/']}",jdg_173799

My logic was in  real life most of the things we do are not linear functions and derivatives helps to make a real life functions into linear. eg converting parabola into a linear function $x^{2}\rightarrow 2x$ but then i find this; derivation of $\sin{x}\rightarrow \cos{x}$ why we cant use $\sin{x}$ itself to solve the equation. whats the purpose of using its derivative $\cos{x}$.Please forgive me if i have asked a stupid questions, i want to improve my fundamentals in calculus.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","My example is from the real life situation of war. From experiments in physics we know that the acceleration due to gravity of a particle near the Earth's surface is about $-9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$. If you're an artilleryman in an army, you want your artillery shells to hit the enemy, or else theirs may hit you and kill you (game over). So you need to know how to angle your artillerygun and which direction to point it in so that when the shell lands, it blows up your enemy (rather than missing). All you know is that you can control the direction your cannon points and the angle you fire it in in the air -- after it's fired gravity takes over and that $-9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$ takes over the situation. Calculus shows us that if $x(t)$ is the function representing the position of the artillery shell at time $t$, then its first derivative is the shell's velocity and its second derivative is the shell's acceleration. We know acceleration from physics (it's that $-9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$ we had earlier)! We write this as $x''(t) = -9.8 \frac{m}{s^2}$. From this equation (involving derivatives) you can calculate (using ""integration"") the position function $x(t)$ of the particle given the direction you fire it in and the angle you fire it at. Why do you care about that? Because knowing $x(t)$ will tell you where your shell lands and thus whether your shot will kill the enemy or not. So you can do a quick calculation to determine which direction and which angle to fire in to ensure that your shell hits your target. The side that does this computation first and gets the shell in the air first will kill the other side, helping win the war.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/160821', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/23624/']}",jdg_238476

Question:
Modern telescopes go to great lengths to have perfectly shaped parabolic mirrors. My question is, why go to the trouble of having a perfect mirror? Why not take a mirror roughly the right shape, and then correct for the distortion using computers?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","correct for the distortion An imperfect mirror does not produce a distorted image - it produces a blurry image. With light-field sensors and phase imaging, one could possibly correct for the blur, but it is much more challenging problem than normal lens distortion correction. Distortion refers to a systematic change in how shapes are projected in an image. It results from a lens or mirror with good, accurate geometry that just does not produce a rectilinear projection. Random imperfections in a mirror do not cause distortion. Every point in the surface of a mirror contributes to every pixel in the result image. If a single part of the mirror is at slightly wrong angle, it does not cause a distortion in one point of the image. Instead, it projects the same image at a slightly different alignment on the same sensor. (1) In the case of a starfield, this would cause ghost images of very dim stars to appear next to the real stars. Repeat this for a thousand imperfections, and the result is just blurry dots. Deconvolution is a process that can be used to remove blurriness, but noise and other uncertainties limit its effectiveness. (1) This may be a bit unintuitive if you think about funhouse mirrors where the image is distorted. Those work differently because they act the part of a planar mirror, where indeed each part of image is reflected by a single part of a mirror. But planar mirrors cannot form an image by themselves, instead the lens in your eye is the critical component of the image accuracy.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/43810', 'https://astronomy.stackexchange.com', 'https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/users/39332/']}",jdg_203646

Question:
I have a treeview-widget inside a ScrolledWindow , which is populated during runtime. I want the ScrolledWindow to auto-scroll to the end of the list. I ""solved"" the problem, by adjusting the vadjustment of the ScrolledWindow , everytime a row is inserted into the treeview. e.g: if new_line_in_row:   adj = self.scrolled_window.get_vadjustment()   adj.set_value( adj.upper - adj.page_size ) If i run the code in an interactive ipython session and set the value by myself, everything works as expected. If i run the code with the default python interpreter, the auto-scroll doesn't work all the time. I debugged the code and the problem seems be, that the adjustment values have some kind of ""lag"" and are only changed after some period of time.

I want to extract some information from the DOM with Selenium. I'm using the C# WebDriver. Looking at the IWebElement interface you can easily extract a given attribute.

","The .attributes property in JavaScript will return an array of all the attributes a given element has and it's value. So what you'll need to do is first get a driver that has the capability to run JavaScript: IJavascriptExecutor javascriptDriver = (IJavaScriptExecutor)driver; Now, execute it by: Dictionary<string, object> attributes = javascriptDriver.ExecuteScript(""var items = {}; for (index = 0; index < arguments[0].attributes.length; ++index) { items[arguments[0].attributes[index].name] = arguments[0].attributes[index].value }; return items;"", element) as Dictionary<string, object>; The idea behind the JavaScript is to use the JavaScript attributes property within the element itself and then pull out the information we need - the name and value of the attribute. The attributes property, in reality, pulls a lot of information about each individual property but we want only two fields. So we get those two fields, put them into a dictionary and WebDriver will then parse it back to us. (It could probably be cleaned up a bit) It's now a Dictionary and thus you can loop through however you like. The key of each pair will be the name of the attribute, and the value of each pair will be the value of the attribute.

Question:
The reason for lambda expressions is implicitly generate function objects in a ""more convenient way"". As you can see from the example below, it is not only less convenient and longer, but also has a confusing syntax and notation. Are there any uses of this, where it actually makes code more readable? cout << count(vec, [&](int a){ return a < x; }) << endl;  // lambdacout << count(vec, Less_than<int> (x)) << endl;           // normal functor def-n

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It is more readable because it places the implementation of the function right into the spot where it is called, thus keeping the natural top-to-bottom flow of code unchanged. You see, ordinary functions have their pros and cons. On the one hand, functions help reduce repetitions in the code, this making the code more structured and more readable. On the other hand, functions break the natural flow of code and transfer control to a completely different location. This can reduce the readability for rather obvious reasons: it is like reading a book that is riddled with nested forward and backward references. So, in order to properly take advantage of the properties of ordinary functions, one should use them to implement well-thought-through, complete and isolated abstractions. That way ordinary functions will improve the readability of the code. But for small ""disposable"" one-time-use utility code, ordinary functions don't work so well. They can actually makes the code significantly less readable. This is where lambda functions come in. They allow one to inject that disposable utility code straight into the point of the call, where it is necessary.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/18168022', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1367392/']}",jdg_323197

Doing this would essentially make the css variables useless but I implore you to still use them because it will serve as an important reminder to the fact that these values are referenced elsewhere and need to be updated in all cases, otherwise you forget to update every related occurrence of 'color' and then you have inconsistent styling because relevant css values are out of sync.

In some rare situations this can be null.   } The getLastLocation() method returns a Task that you can use to get a Location object with the latitude and longitude coordinates  of a geographic location. The location object may be null in the  following situations: Location is turned off in the device settings. The result could be  null even if the last location was previously retrieved because  disabling location also clears the cache. The device never recorded  its location, which could be the case of a new device or a device that  has been restored to factory settings. Google Play services on the  device has restarted, and there is no active Fused Location Provider  client that has requested location after the services restarted. To  avoid this situation you can create a new client and request location  updates yourself. For more information, see Receiving Location  Updates. But it does not say how to handle this, what can I do?

Question:
I recently found myself at a spot that I never believed I'll get (or at least not that soon in my career). I ran into a problem which seems to be best answered via categories. The situation is this, I have a directed system of structures and the maps are all the inclusion map, that is $X_i$ for $i\in I$ where $(I,\leq)$ is a directed set; and if $i\leq j$ then $X_i$ is a substructure of $X_j$ . Suppose that the direct limit of the system exists. Can I be certain that this direct limit is actually the union? Namely, what sort of categories would ensure this, and what possible counterexamples are there? I asked several folks around the department today, some assured me that this is the case for concrete categories, while others assured me that a counterexample can be found (although it won't be organic, and would probably be manufactured for this case). The situation is such that the direct system is originating from forcing, so it's quite... wide and probably immune to some of the ""thinkable"" counterexamples (by arguments of [set theoretical] genericity from one angle or another), and so any counterexample which is essentially a linearly ordered system is not going to be useful as a counterexample. Another typical counterexample which is irrelevant here is finitely-generated things, for example we can take a direct system of f.g. vector spaces whose limit is not f.g. but this aspect is also irrelevant to me; although I am not sure how to accurately describe this sort of irrelevance. Last point (which came up with every person I discussed this question today), if we consider: $$\mathbb R\hookrightarrow\mathbb R^2\hookrightarrow\ldots$$ Then we consider those to be actually increasing sets in inclusion and not ""natural identifications"" as commonly done in categories. So the limit of the above would actually be $\mathbb R^{<\omega}$ (all finite sequences from $\mathbb R$ ).

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Your question essentially amounts to asking, ""when does the forgetful functor $U : \mathcal{C} \to \textbf{Set}$ create directed colimits?"" More generally, one could replace ""directed colimit"" by ""filtered colimit"". There is, as far as I know, no general answer. Here is one reasonably general class of categories $\mathcal{C}$ for which there is such a forgetful functor. Let us consider a finitary algebraic theory $\mathfrak{T}$, i.e. a one-sorted first-order theory with a set of operations of finite arity and whose axioms form a set of universally-quantified equations. For example, $\mathfrak{T}$ could be the theory of groups, or the theory of $R$-modules for any fixed $R$-module. Then, the category $\mathcal{C}$ of models of $\mathfrak{T}$ will be a category in which filtered colimits are, roughly speaking, obtained by taking the union of the underlying sets. This can be proven ""by hand"", by showing that the obvious construction has the required universal property: the key lemma is that filtered colimits commute with finite limits in $\textbf{Set}$ – so, for example, $\varinjlim_{\mathcal{J}} X \times \varinjlim_{\mathcal{J}} Y \cong \varinjlim_{\mathcal{J}} X \times Y$ if $\mathcal{J}$ is a filtered category. Mac Lane spells out the details in [CWM, Ch. IX, §3, Thm 1]. Addenda. Fix a one-sorted first-order signature $\Sigma$. Consider the directed colimit of the underlying sets of some $\Sigma$-structures: notice that the colimit inherits a $\Sigma$-structure if and only if the operations and predicates of $\Sigma$ are all finitary. Qiaochu's counterexample with $\{ 0 \} \subset \{ 0, 1 \} \subset \{ 0, 1, 2 \} \subset \cdots$ can be pressed into service here as well. So let us assume $\Sigma$ only has finitary operations and predicates. The problem is now to establish an analogue of Łoś's theorem for directed colimits. Let $\mathcal{J}$ be a directed set and let $X : \mathcal{J} \to \Sigma \text{-Str}$ be a directed system of $\Sigma$-structures. Let us say that a logical formula $\phi$ is ""good"" just if $X_j \vDash \phi$ for all $X_j$ implies $\varinjlim X \vDash \phi$ (where $\varinjlim X$ is computed in $\textbf{Set}$ and given the induced $\Sigma$-structure). It is not hard to check that universally quantified equations and atomic predicates are good formulae. The set of good formulae is closed under conjunction and disjunction. The set of good formulae is closed under universal quantification. The set of good formulae is not closed under existential quantification: the formula $\forall x . \, x \le m$ (with free variable $m$) is a good formula in the signature of posets, but $\exists m . \, \forall x . \, x \le m$ is clearly not preserved by direct limits. However, a quantifier-free good formula is still a good formula when prefixed with any number of existential quantifiers. In particular, the set of good formulae is not closed under negation: the property of being unbounded above can be expressed as a good formula in the signature of posets with inequality, but its negation is the property of being bounded above. Section 6.5 of [Hodges, Model theory ] seems to have some relevant material, but I haven't read it yet. The point, I suppose, is that there are some fairly strong conditions that the theory in question must satisfy before the directed colimit in $\textbf{Set}$ is even a model of the theory, let alone be a directed colimit in the category of models of the theory.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/164340', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/622/']}",jdg_282791

","Because the c# compiler intepretes the third ActivityStatus in: public const ActivityStatus ActivityStatus = ActivityStatus.Open; as the name of the constant being defined instead than the name of the enumeration - hence the circular reference: you are definining a constant in terms of the constant itself. In C# you can use the same name for members and types, and usually resolve ambiguities specifying the fully qualified names (i.e. adding the namespace), but in my experience it is not a good idea, it makes code confusing: the compiler can figure out which is which, but the poor human reading the code has an hard time figuring out if a certain name refers to a class or type or member.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/12729147', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1304456/']}",jdg_312404

Question:
For every force there is an equal force in the opposite direction on another body, correct? So when the Suns gravity acts on Earth where is the opposite and equal force? I also have the same question for centripetal force in a planets orbit.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As many others said, the Sun feels the same force towards Earth as the Earth feels towards the sun. That is your equal and opposite force. In practice though the ""visible"" effects of a force can be deduced through Newton's first law, i.e. ${\bf F} = m{\bf a}$. In other words, you need to divide the force by the mass of the body to determine the net effect on the body itself. So: ${\bf F_s} = {\bf F_e}$ ${\bf F_s} = m_s {\bf a_s}$ ${\bf F_e} = m_e {\bf a_e}$ therefore, $m_s {\bf a_s} = m_e {\bf a_e}$ and ${\bf a_s} = {\bf a_s} \frac{m_e}{m_s}$ Now, the last term is $3 \cdot 10^{-6}$! This means that the force that the Earth enacts on the sun is basically doing nothing to the sun. Another way of seeing this: $F = \frac{G m_s m_e}{r^2}$ $a_s = \frac{F}{m_s} = \frac{G m_e}{r^2}$ $a_e = \frac{F}{m_e} = \frac{G m_s}{r^2}$ $\frac{a_s}{a_e} = \frac{m_e}{m_s} = 3 \cdot 10^{-6}$ Again, the same big difference in effect. Regarding the centripetal force, it is still the same force. Gravity provides a centripetal force which is what keeps Earth in orbit. Note It's worth pointing out that the mass that acts as the charge for gravity, known as gravitational mass is not, a priori, the same mass that appears in Newtons's law, known as inertial mass . On the other hand it is a fact of nature that they have the same value, and as such we may use a single symbol $m$, instead of two, $m_i$ and $m_g$. This is an underlying, unspoken assumption in the derivation above. This is known as the weak equivalence principle .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/102', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com', 'https://physics.stackexchange.com/users/4/']}",jdg_196026

Question:
I have an assignment on proof by induction: Suppose $n$ is a positive integer. An equilateral triangle is cut into  $4^n$ congruent equilateral triangles, and one corner is removed. (Figure  $1$ shows an example with $n = 2$). Show that the remaining area can be  covered with the trapezoidal tiles of Figure $2$. Figure $1$ Figure $2$ I have tried to prove it in this way: Base Case : $n = 1 \rightarrow 4^1$ = $4$ So we have an equilateral triangle with $4$ smaller congruent equilateral triangles. Now, we remove one of them, and we remain with $3$ triangles, which can be occupied by a tile (Figure $2$). Inductive hypothesis: Let $n$ be arbitrary.Suppose an equilateral triangle is cut into $4^n$ smaller congruent equilateral triangles. We remove $1$ of these smaller triangles, and now we can cover all the big equilateral triangle with $k$ tiles, which is equals to $\frac{4^n - 1}{3}$. Why divided by $3$? Because the tile is composed of 3 smaller congruent equilateral triangles. Inductive step: Assume the point $2$ is true. Let's prove for $n + 1$, so let's suppose that an equilateral triangle is cut into $4^{n+1}$ smaller congruent equilateral triangles, which means $4 * 4^n$ triangles. We know how to fill $4^n$ triangles, so we know also how to fill $1 * 4^n$, right? So we also know how to fill them when they are $2 * 4^n$, $3 * 4^n$ or $4 * 4^n$. Thus, we proved that we can fill an equilateral triangle divided into $4^n$ with those tiles. I don't think my proof is correct, that's why I am asking your help. Actually, it does not seem even a proof. In particular, if it's wrong, I would like to know why. I did not understand well how to prove by induction yet, so it would be great if you can help me to understand it better!

Question:
Let $f:(-1,1)\to \mathbb{R}$ be a twice differentiable function such that, $f(0)=1$, $f'(x)≤0$, $f(x)≥0$ and $f''(x)≤f(x)$ for all $x≥0$. Prove that, $f'(0)≥-\sqrt2$ Progress: I was able to prove $f'(0)≥-2$. For this I have applied Cauchy MVT for $f'$ and $g$ on $[0,x]$ for any $x\in (0,1)$ where $g: [0,x]\to\mathbb{R}$ is defined by, $g(x)=\sqrt{x+1}$. But, couldn't find another approach to get $-\sqrt{2}$.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Initially I had posted a solution but it was incorrect. Here's a final solution. Beautiful problem, by the way. For any $x\in(0,1)$, we can write, for some $c\in(0,x)$ that $f(x)=f(0)+f'(0)x+\dfrac{f''(c)x^2}{2}\leq 1+f'(0)x+\dfrac{f(c)x^2}{2}\leq1 + f'(0)x +\dfrac{x^2}{2}$ since $f(x)\leq1$ for $x\in(0,1)$. Now using $f''(x)\leq f(x)$ we see that $f''(x)\leq f'(0)x + \dfrac{x^2}{2}+1$. Integrating both sides from $0$ to $x$ we have, $f'(x)-f'(0)\leq \dfrac{f'(0)x^2}{2}+x+\dfrac{x^3}{6}$ and again integrate from $0$ to $x$ for any $x\in(0,1)$. We get $f'(0)(x+\dfrac{x^3}{6})\geq-\dfrac{x^2}{2}-\dfrac{x^4}{24}+f(x)-f(0)\geq-\dfrac{x^2}{2}-\dfrac{x^4}{24}-1$ Finally we have $$f'(0)\geq \dfrac{-\dfrac{x^2}{2}-\dfrac{x^4}{24}-1}{x+\dfrac{x^3}{6}}$$for any $x\in(0,1)$. Note that the function on the right side is increasing and achieves its maximum at $x=1$, where its value is $\dfrac{-37}{28}>-\sqrt{2}$. Hence $f'(0)\geq \sup_{x\in(0,1)}\dfrac{-\dfrac{x^2}{2}-\dfrac{x^4}{24}-1}{x+\dfrac{x^3}{6}}=\dfrac{-37}{28}>-\sqrt{2}$.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1329309', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/125828/']}",jdg_351592

Question:
The Jurassic Park scene referenced in the title is infamous for how ludicrous it sounds to those who are tech literate.  But it also illustrates what seems to me to be a glaringly huge hole in web security, particularly IoT devices--as soon as attackers find out a server or camera or baby monitor is running linux, they instantly know volumes about how it works.  They know that commands like sudo are big juicy targets and they know that shell access will bring with it gobs of useful tools like ls and cat . So why isn't OS obfuscation more of a thing? I'm not talking about just hiding the version in web headers.  Similar to JavaScript minification or obfuscation, I'm talking about changing the names of binaries and filepaths in the OS itself. Wouldn't entire classes of attacks be practically useless if the OS had ha7TrUO and RRI6e29 commands instead of sudo and ls ?  Imagine a hacker that somehow gained remote root access--what are they even going to do if they don't know any commands? Implementation would be fairly easy for compilers.  Take the simplest case of ""rename this function and all calls to it."" You could give an OS compiler and an application compiler the same randomized names and they'd be able to talk to each other. But even if the application has poor security and is vulnerable to bash injection, such attacks would be fruitless. Obviously this technique can't be used in all scenarios.  Setting aside scenarios like servers maintained by human sysadmins, it seems to me that any device or server managed by automation is a prime candidate for this defense. I guess the question(s) needs to be a bit more concrete: Is OS obfuscation as described used widely and I just haven't encountered it? If not used widely, what are the practical or technical barriers to usage?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Before I tear your idea apart, let me say that it's a really interesting idea and it was super fun to think about. Please continue to think outside the box and ask interesting questions! Alright, let's do this! Let's take a step back and ask why that baby monitor is running Linux in the first place? What if there was no operating system and the application was written in bare microcontroller code (think arduino code)? Then there would be no sudo or ls or even a shell for the attacker to use, right? I'm not an expert here, but I expect that we, as an industry, have gravitated towards putting Linux on anything big enough to run it largely for developer convenience: Reducing dev time: When building your WiFi-and-bluetooth-capable web-administered cloud-syncing self-patching whizpopper with companion Android and iOS apps, Linux comes with all the libraries, utilities, and drivers you need to do that. Increasing testability: If the device is running bash or busybox with an SSH port, then it's super easy to connect in and figure out what went wrong during your product testing phase. For your obfuscation idea to work, you'd need to obfuscate not only the names of command-line utilities like sudo and ls , but also every Linux kernel API to prevent the attacker from dropping in their own compiled binary that calls the kernel directly. So let's take another look at your idea: Implementation would be fairly easy for compilers. Take the simplest case of ""rename this function and all calls to it."" You could give an OS compiler and an application compiler the same randomized names and they'd be able to talk to each other. You'll need to do this randomized compilation yourself; otherwise someone could look up the mappings on google. So, you'll need to build the kernel from source with your ""obfuscating compiler"" so that only you know the mappings of the obfuscated kernel APIs. (ever built the linux kernel from source? It's certainly more of a chore than docker pull alpine , which is the direction that dev culture seems to be going) . But an operating system is more than just the kernel. You want drivers for the Broadcom BCM2837 wifi chip that comes on that mini-pc device? You'll need to build that driver against your obfuscated kernel with your compiler, if Broadcom will even give you the source code. Then you'll need to build the entire GNU wifi and networking software stacks. How many other things will you need to find source for and add to your build pipeline before you have a functioning OS? Oh, and if the upstream repos of any of those things issues a patch, you're now responsible for re-building it (assuming you saved the compiler obfuscation mapping files that match your kernel binary) and pushing it out to your devices because - by design - your devices can not use patch binaries produced by the vendor. Oh, and in order to foil hackers, there'll be none of this ""Here's the binary files for Whizpopper 1.4.7"" , oh no, you'll need to build a uniquely obfuscated version of everything from the kernel up per device that you ship. So to your questions: Is OS obfuscation as described used widely and I just haven't encountered it? If not used widely, what are the practical or technical barriers to usage? I think the answer is that what you're describing pretty much completely defeats the purpose of using pre-existing software components if you need to find and build literally everything from source. It might actually be less effort to ditch the operating system entirely, pretend it's 1960, and write your application directly in CPU microcode.

","You can use jQuery to chain on load handlers. Repeatedly using jQuery.load or jQuery(document).ready will chain your handlers (I believe). You other option is to do it programmatically, which means you need an auxiliary function that will chain your onload handlers for you. You can do this with a closure (or anonymous function): var addOnLoadHandler = function(newHandler) {    if (typeof window.onload != 'function') {        window.onload = newHandler;    }    else {        var oldHandler = window.onload;        window.onload = function() {            if (oldHandler) {                oldHandler();            }            newHandler();        };    }}; You will have to bind your functions programmatically though, so you would have to do: addOnLoadHandlers(function() { alert(""Hi I am the first onLoad handler!"");});addOnLoadHandlers(function() { alert(""Hi I am the second onLoad handler!"");}); in a javascript file (or in your html file). Another approach is to use an array: var onloaders = new Array();function runOnLoads() {    for (i = 0; i < onloaders.length; i++) {        try {            var handler = onloaders[i];            handler();        } catch(error) {            alert(error.message);        }    }}function addLoader(obj) {    onloaders[onloaders.length] = obj;} In your HTML or Javascript file you do: addLoader(function() { alert(""Hi I am the first onLoad handler!"");});addLoader(function() { alert(""Hi I am the second onLoad handler!"");}); Then in your html you can just do <body onload=""runOnLoads()"">",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2276961', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/266159/']}",jdg_94381

Question:
I've installed Ghostscript on Windows as what I'm looking to do is compress/reduce the size of 12,000+ PDF files on a network share. This wouldn't be possible with any GUI software as it just bombs out after a while due to running out of resources, so I think command line is the way to go here. I've read the Ghostscript documentation and different examples of compressing PDF files, but I can't seem to find anything that operates as a large batch. Basically, I'd need to target multiple folders to recursively compress the files which will be on the network share. Is this possible to do so with Ghostscript? If so, please advise with some command examples to help me acheive this. Thanks!

","With the following script you can define all directories needed in the array variable filesDir . It will loop over all these directories and search for all pdf files in all directories including subdirectories.

Edit #1: I changed the script as requested by the comments to either write new pdf files or overwrite the input pdf file. To select between these to options change the createNewPDFs variable to 1 (new files) or 0 (overwrite). Because ghostscript can't write to the input file the output file will be written at the users temporary path ( %TEMP% ) and moved to the original input file to overwite this file. It will only overwrite the input pdf file if the new file is smaller in size.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Are i32 better for performance? That's actually kind of a subtle thing. If we look up some recent instruction-level benchmarks for example for SkylakeX , there is for the most part a very clear lack of difference between 64bit and 32bit instructions. An exception to that is division, 64bit division is slower than 32bit division, even when dividing the same values (division is one of the few variable-time instructions that depend on the values of its inputs). Using i64 for data also makes auto-vectorization less effective - this is also one of the rare places where data smaller than 32bit has a use beyond data-size optimization. Of course the data size also matters for the i32 vs i64 question, working with sizable arrays of i64's can easily be slower just because it's bigger, therefore costing more space in the caches and (if applicable) more bandwidth. So if the question is [i32] vs [i64] , then it matters. Even more subtle is the fact that using 64bit operations means that the code will contains more REX prefixes on average, making the code slightly less dense meaning that less of it will fit in the L1 code cache at once. This is a small effect though. Just having some 64bit variables in the code is not a problem. Despite all that, definitely don't overuse i32, especially in places where you should really have an usize . For example, do not do this: // don't do thisfor i in 0i32 .. data.len() as i32 {   sum += data[i as usize]; } This causes a large performance regression. Not only is there a pointless sign-extension in the loop now, it also defeats bounds check elimination and auto-vectorization. But of course there is no reason to write code like that in the first place, it's unnatural and harder than doing it right.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/51685509', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4521803/']}",jdg_72105

Question:
In my iOS application I'm writing, I deal with PNGs because I deal with the alpha channel.  For some reason, I can load a PNG into my imageView just fine, but when it comes time to either copy the image out of my application (onto the PasteBoard) or save the image to my camera roll, the image rotates 90 degrees. I've searched everywhere on this, and one of the things I learned is that if I used JPEGs, I wouldn't have this problem (it sounds), due to the EXIF information. My app has full copy/paste functionality, and here's the kicker (I'll write this in steps so it is easier to follow): Go to my camera roll and copy an image Go into my app and press ""Paste"", image pastes just fine, and I can do that all day Click the copy function I implemented, and then click ""Paste"", and the image pastes but is rotated. I am 100% sure my copy and paste code isn't what is wrong here, because if I go back to Step 2 above, and click ""save"", the photo saves to my library but it is rotated 90 degrees! What is even more strange is that it seems to work fine with images downloaded from the internet, but is very hit or miss with images I manually took with the phone.  Some it works, some it doesn't... Does anybody have any thoughts on this?  Any possible work arounds I can use?  I'm pretty confident in the code being it works for about 75% of my images.  I can post the code upon request though.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Took a few days, but I finally figured it out thanks to the answer @Dondragmer posted.  But I figured I'd post my full solution. So basically I had to write a method to intelligently auto-rotate my images.  The downside is that I have to call this method everywhere throughout my code and it is kind of processor intensive, especially when working on mobile devices, but the plus side is that I can take images, copy images, paste images, and save images and they all rotate properly.  Here's the code I ended up using (the method isn't 100% complete yet, still need to edit memory leaks and what not). I ended up learning that the very first time an image was insert into my application (whether that be due to a user pressing ""take image"", ""paste image"", or ""select image"", for some reason it insert just fine without auto rotating.  At this point, I stored whatever the rotation value was in a global variable called imageOrientationWhenAddedToScreen .  This made my life easier because when it came time to manipulate the image and save the image out of the program, I simply checked this cached global variable and determined if I needed to properly rotate the image. - (UIImage*) rotateImageAppropriately:(UIImage*) imageToRotate {    //This method will properly rotate our image, we need to make sure that    //We call this method everywhere pretty much...    CGImageRef imageRef = [imageToRotate CGImage];    UIImage* properlyRotatedImage;    if (imageOrientationWhenAddedToScreen == 0) {       //Don't rotate the image        properlyRotatedImage = imageToRotate;    } else if (imageOrientationWhenAddedToScreen == 3) {        //We need to rotate the image back to a 3        properlyRotatedImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:imageRef scale:1.0 orientation:3];    } else if (imageOrientationWhenAddedToScreen == 1) {        //We need to rotate the image back to a 1        properlyRotatedImage = [UIImage imageWithCGImage:imageRef scale:1.0 orientation:1];            }    return properlyRotatedImage;} I am still not 100% sure why Apple has this weird image rotation behavior (try this... Take your phone and turn it upside down and take a picture, you'll notice that the final picture turns out right side up - perhaps this is why Apple has this type of functionality?).

I tried the below which works, but if there's no current_user, the the textfield doesn't show. <div class=""form-group"">  <label>Email</label>   <%= f.text_field :email, required: true, class: 'form-control', value:current_user.email if current_user  %></div>

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Its not showing because the if statement applies to the whole text-field, not just the value attribute.  This will work: <% if current_user %>    <%= f.text_field :email, required: true, class: 'form-control', value:current_user.email  %><% else %>    <%= f.text_field :email, required: true, class: 'form-control'%><% end %> However, if you are using devise, it comoes with a helper method that is generally better to user than current_user.

Question:
So I've been looking through and going through my Digital Computer Electronics book, and I came to this... It seems so simple and I understand the ""point"" of it, but I'm not sure I understand exactly how it works. ""In a Schottky transistor, the Schottky diode shunts current from the base into the collector before the transistor goes into saturation."" I guess this part confuses me above ^^^ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schottky_transistor From what I gather the Schottky Diode has a forward voltage of .25 V... So it's taking .25 V out of the Input Line (coming from the left of the picture) and putting THAT into the collector... So it'll just take less time to switch... Because there is .25 V less coming in the base? Or is adding .25 V to the collector so when the Transistor turns ""on"" it'll already have a little bit flowing through it (since .25 V isn't enough to actually flow through when it's off?)? Wikipedia entry is confusing. I feel pretty stupid for asking such a simple question lol.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","What happens is: As the base voltage rises, the transistor begins to turn on and it's collector voltage drops (assuming it has a collector resistor or similar current limiting element) Normally a typical bipolar transistors saturation voltage is around 200mV or less. When the collector voltage, Vce drops below Vbe - Vschottky though, the schottky starts to conduct (now being forward biased) and the base current starts to flow through it into the collector. This ""steals"" current from the base, preventing the transistor turning on more and the collector reaching it's saturation voltage. The system will reach a state of equilibrium, since the transistor can't turn on any more without it's base current dropping (you could see it as a form of negative feedback) and will settle just around Vbe-Vschotkky (e.g.~700mv-450mV as opposed to ~200mV) So, to clarify things, the formula for Vce is: Vce = Vbe - Vschottky If we have this circuit and apply a ramped voltage from 0-2V: We get simulation results like this: Note that when Vcollector drops below ~700mV, the Schottky begins to conduct and the collector voltage levels out at around 650mV. If we remove the Schottky, then: We can see the collector drops all the way to 89mV (I used the cursor as it's hard to see from the graph)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/55073', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/-1/']}",jdg_223238

Question:
In Java, when one declares a string variable the word ""String"" is capitalized, yet it isn't in any of the other types I've run across (e.g. ""int"" or ""double""). Why is this? Was it just some weird arbitrary decision by the designers?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Why does is declaration of a string variable in Java capitalized? The String type is capitalized because it is a class , like Object , not a primitive type like boolean or int (the other types you probably ran across). As a class, the String follows the Naming Convention for Java proposed by Sun. In short, that coding style dictates that UpperCamelCase be used for classes ( ""Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized"" ) and lowerCamelCase be used for instances and methods. What's the basic difference between String and the primitive types? As an object, a String has some advantages, like properties and methods that can be called directly to them (like the famous length() , replace() and split() ). None of the primitive types have that. What about wrapper classes? The other primitive types have equivalent wrapper classes, like Integer for int and Boolean for boolean . They will allow you additional functions. Since Java 1.5, the conversion from an int to an Integer is made almost seamlessly. This is called autoboxing .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/16702781', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1899565/']}",jdg_335743

Question:
From Introductory Combinatorics by Richard Brualdi We have a chess master. He has 11 weeks to prepare for a competition so he decides that he will practice everyday by playing at least 1 game a day. To make sure that he's able to take a couple of breaks, he also decides that he wont play more than 12 games per week. My question is, how do you prove/dis-prove that there will be a succession of (consecutive) days in which he will play k games, $k \geq  22$? Specifically, I don't quite understand the use of the pigeonhole principle here. Thanks in advance! :D EDIT I'll try to clarify what I'm asking: The goal is to prove that for every possible practice schedule that the chess master makes, there will always be a consecutive sequence of days such that he plays exactly k games. So for example, if k = 22, how do you prove that no matter what his schedule is like, he will always play exactly k games in r days, $1 \leq r\leq  77$. My main question is: what is the general method for proving different values of k ? Are there values of k (from 1 to 132 inclusive) that are impossible to obtain? Note that he does not necessarily have to play 132 games within 77 days!Also, keep in mind the bounds of k .

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","For $\displaystyle 1 \le k \le 24$ you can definitely show that the master must have played exactly $k$ games on some set of consecutive days, using pigeonhole principle. Suppose the total number of games the master has played till the end of day $\displaystyle j$ is $\displaystyle g_j$. Now consider the $\displaystyle 154$ numbers: $\displaystyle g_1, g_2, \dots, g_{77}, g_1 + k, g_2 + k, \dots, g_{77} + k$ These are a set of $\displaystyle 154$ numbers between $\displaystyle 1$ and $\displaystyle 132+k$. For $\displaystyle k \lt 22$, two of these must be equal. Since $\displaystyle g_i \neq g_j$ (at least one game a day) we must have that $\displaystyle g_j + k = g_i$ for some $\displaystyle i,j$. For $\displaystyle k=22$ we must have that the numbers are $\displaystyle 1,2, \dots, 154$, in which case, the first (and last) $\displaystyle 22$ days, the master must have played $\displaystyle 1$ game everyday. For $\displaystyle k=23$, we can assume $\displaystyle g_i \neq 23$, and since $g_i \ge 1$, we have $g_i + k \neq 23$. Thus by an argument similar to above, we must have have $\displaystyle 154$ numbers taking all values in $\displaystyle 1, 2, \dots, 155$, except $\displaystyle 23$ and the master must have played $\displaystyle 1$ game each of the last $\displaystyle 23$ days. For $\displaystyle k=24$, you can show that the master must have played $\displaystyle 1$ game the first $\displaystyle 23$ days (after eliminating one of the numbers in $\displaystyle 133, 134 \dots$), then a big number of games the next, violating the $\displaystyle 12$ games per week restriction (this is where we actually used that restriction for a specific week). We might be able to use this kind of argument to show for $\displaystyle k$ close to $\displaystyle 24$, but for larger $\displaystyle k$, I am guessing that you can find a set of games which will miss that (perhaps a computer search will help there).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/15903', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/5166/']}",jdg_267392

","Cookie.binarycookies: I think this will be helpful. I reversed engineer the file with an hex-editor and start changing the cookies. General description: The file is composed of several pages, each one can have one or more cookies inside. Each page has a header, which is variable, 0x10, 0x14 and 0x1c are common values we can see. File: The file start with  an 4 bytes header that is of no interest. The next 4 bytes are of real interest because they indicate the number of pages there are in the file. Then we have the length of each page, also represented by an 4 byte number. It's important to know that all these numbers are written in big-endian. So, we have 4*number of pages of bytes and then the pages. We have 8 bytes at the end which also are of no interest. Page: Each page has a header whose length can change from one page to another. To know the length of the header, we must discard the first five bytes and the next 4 bytes will indicate the length of the header. Following the header we will have the length of the cookie represented by 4 bytes, ordered in little-endian! This length also includes the 4 bytes needed for representing the length. When this cookie ends another will start and so on to the end of the page. Cookie: The date of each cookies starts at 0x2B. The date is composed by 4 bytes ordered in little-endian.  The date is represented in seconds but not since epoch so we need to subtract this number: 1706047360. (It only works for until some day in 2017) The next field of interest starts from 0x38.

Instead of supporting method overloading Ruby overwrites existing methods. Can anyone explain why the language was designed this way?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Method overloading can be achieved by declaring two methods with the same name and different signatures. These different signatures can be either, Arguments with different data types, eg: method(int a, int b) vs method(String a, String b) Variable number of arguments, eg: method(a) vs method(a, b) We cannot achieve method overloading using the first way because there is no data type declaration in ruby( dynamic typed language ). So the only way to define the above method is def(a,b) With the second option, it might look like we can achieve method overloading, but we can't.

","I had the same problem today and was able to figure it out. None of the listed solutions here worked so I thought I'd share what fixed it for me. TL;DR: If you are dynamically setting the text of the TextView, try setting the required ""marquee"" properties in code instead of in the layout xml file. Longer version: In my case, I had a GridView with an adapter and a TextView in each item. Some of the item's had text that was too long to fit in its ""cell"" of the grid, and thus I wanted all items that were too long to scroll a few times. Being that the TextView is in a GridView with an adapter, the text was obviously being set in code, from the current item of the adapter. Through much painful debugging, I finally had the idea to set all of the marquee settings in code instead of in the layout xml file. This caused the 3 dots (...) to finally go away from the TextView and begin scrolling instead. Here's what my layout file looks like now:(note that none of the properties listed above are set here) <TextViewandroid:text=""Placeholder""android:layout_width=""wrap_content""android:layout_height=""wrap_content""android:textSize=""16dp""android:id=""@+id/name""/> And here's what my adapter code looks like: nameView.setText(name);nameView.setEllipsize(TextUtils.TruncateAt.MARQUEE);nameView.setSingleLine(true);nameView.setMarqueeRepeatLimit(5);nameView.setSelected(true);",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/17402929', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/304151/']}",jdg_351030

Question:
Thus far mathematicians have developed many powerful tests on the convergence of a positive series (I mean $\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}a_i$ specifically), such as : Cauchy's Test which deals with the upper limit of $\lambda_n=\sqrt[n]{a_n}$, but comes to nothing when the upper limit is $1$. D'Alembert's Test which deals with the upper or lower limit of $\lambda_n=\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}$, but comes to nothing when the upper limit $\ge1$ or the lower limit $\le1$. Raabe's Test which deals with $\lambda_n= n\Big(\frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}}-1\Big)$, but comes to nothing when $\lim{\lambda_n}=1$. Bertrand's Test which deals with  $\lambda_n= (\ln n)\Big[n\Big(\frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}}-1\Big)-1\Big]$, but still comes to nothing when $\lim\lambda_n=1$. $$\vdots$$ And in my books it says, this progress never ends, ""...We can always go on and establish a even more powerful test, with more complicated proof, though..."" I don't really know how, but since this is not the point of my question, you may just skip it. Well, anyhow I hope you could take a close look at these tests. They are really brilliant in that they can tell you whether the series converges or otherwise based directly on the information of $a_n$, which won't be too obscure. But they are still NOT perfect. They are all ""if"" type but not ""iff"" type. I mean, they are all of such pattern: The series converges if $\lim \lambda_n$ blah blah blah, and diverges if $\lim \lambda_n$ blah blah blah. The worst is, if they both fail us, WE KNOW NOTHING! How I hope that I could replace ""if""s with ""iff""s, and get rid of the ""we know nothing"" case! So I'm quite wondering whether there is a perfect test that: (1) is based directly on $\lambda_n$ which $a_n$ gives rise to (2) is of such pattern as: The series converges iff $\lim \lambda_n$ blah blah blah, and diverges iff $\lim \lambda_n$ blah blah blah. (Say, we know everything!) I know there might be only dim hope, but I'm still curious. Any help will be specially appreciated. Best regards! Further Note In the first place, I'm sincerely grateful to all the help you guys provide for me. However, I'm afraid I have to make a note here because many answers posted here are not what I'm looking for. Well I'm far from criticizing, but I think I need to perhaps make my question clearer so that I'm not misleading your answers. The problem is that some answers here do not really meet the requirement (1) mentioned in my question. Please read (1) closely, I want the test to be based directly on $\lambda_n$ to which $a_n$ gives rise, just like the $\lambda_n$s in the tests listed above. In other words, $\lambda_n$ should be immediately accessible via $a_n$, or, $a_n$ gives all the immediate information needed to write out $\lambda_n$. Therefore, $\lambda_n$ is an expression that contains $a_n, a_{n+1}$ etc etc. I don't want to involve the partial sum in my test, nor am I looking for something like a powerful comparison test, because the knowledge of $a_n$ usually cannot enable us to gain the knowledge of the partial sum, or to find another $b_n$ to compare to. In short, I desire something that is based only and immediately on $a_n$. Thanks. (And, apologies if my post should look too wordy. I'm not a skillful English user)

I'm trying to measure the disk IO latencies of a running process to make a histogram. I could do this with DTrace in operating systems that provide it (e.g. as in this Joyent paper ), but my application is running in Linux. My first thought was to try perf , and I can get counters but I can't find any way to get time deltas.

Yes strace may not be appropriate, since it will trace everything (all syscalls, even when you use -e filter) and will load server and slower process considerably. Perf is very obscure tool, you may have moments you think you understand its output, but you actually didn't, and its feature set is highly depend on kernel version.

It is about this piece of code: private void dfs(Graph G, int v) {    count++;    marked[v] = true;    for (int w : G.adj(v)) {        if (!marked[w]) {            dfs(G, w);        }    }} I do not understand what ""w"" is about?! Thanks. EDIT: Here is the full code, maybe it will help you more to know excatly what is going on here: package edu.princeton.cs.algs4;public class DepthFirstSearch {    private boolean[] marked;    // marked[v] = is there an s-v path?    private int count;           // number of vertices connected to s    public DepthFirstSearch(Graph G, int s) {        marked = new boolean[G.V()];        validateVertex(s);        dfs(G, s);    }    private void dfs(Graph G, int v) {        count++;        marked[v] = true;        for (int w : G.adj(v)) {            if (!marked[w]) {                dfs(G, w);            }        }    }    public boolean marked(int v) {        validateVertex(v);        return marked[v];    }    public int count() {        return count;    }    private void validateVertex(int v) {        int V = marked.length;        if (v < 0 || v >= V)            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""vertex "" + v + "" is not between 0 and "" + (V-1));    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        In in = new In(args[0]);        Graph G = new Graph(in);        int s = Integer.parseInt(args[1]);        DepthFirstSearch search = new DepthFirstSearch(G, s);        for (int v = 0; v < G.V(); v++) {            if (search.marked(v))                StdOut.print(v + "" "");        }        StdOut.println();        if (search.count() != G.V()) StdOut.println(""NOT connected"");        else                         StdOut.println(""connected"");    }}

Question:
I was reading a textbook which syas: In asynchronous transmission, we send 1 start bit (0) at the beginning and 1 or morestop bits (1s) at the end of each byte. There may be a gap between bytes.Asynchronous here means “asynchronous at the byte level,” but the bits are still synchronized; their durations are the same. I am a little bit confused here, what does bits are still synchronized mean? how does bits gets synchronized and whom those bits gets synchronized to?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I find that textbook description very confusing. The sender of the data is generating a clock which determines where the edges of the bits are. The receiver generates its own clock which determines, in simple terms, when we sample the data stream to get the correct bit values. This clock will not be synchronised with the senders clock, even if it starts off synchronised the frequency will be a little off and it will drift over time. So the receiver re-synchronises its clock every byte by sensing the edge of the start bit. This means that the bits in a byte are synchronised and they are synchronised to the start bit.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/505515', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/200690/']}",jdg_92979

","Short : This is because of operator precedence. The first case is equal to this: x = (b ? (y=1) : 2);  // Compiles OK. While the second is: x = (b ? 1 : y) = 2; The first one compiles indeed fine, because an assignment gets evaluated to the new value. So, if b is true, it will cause to be both x and y equal to 1. The second one is like saying: x = 1 = 2 . So, yes, to fix this compiler error, add paratheses to your statement: x = (b ? 1 : (y = 2));  // Outer () are not needed, but is clearer, IMHO. Longer : First of all, operator precedence in Java says that the assignment operators have lower priority than the conditional ternary operator. This means that your second expression is equivalent to: x = (b ? 1 : y) = 2; As you can see, this looks plain wrong. Indeed, JLS §15.26 says this: There are 12 assignment operators; all are syntactically right-associative (they group right-to-left). Thus, a=b=c means a=(b=c) , which assigns the value of c to b and then assigns the value of b to a . The result of the first operand of an assignment operator must be a variable , or a compile-time error occurs. (This explains the compile time error you face) At run time, the result of the assignment expression is the value of the variable after the assignment has occurred. The result of an assignment expression is not itself a variable. Applying right-associativity: x = ((b ? 1 : y) = 2); Finally we can see why this generates a compiler error: the result of a ternary conditional operator is not a variable (which is actually not in the JLS as far as I can find, however the compiler tells you in a simple test case like this one: https://ideone.com/kMr7Xv ).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/20399932', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/467875/']}",jdg_321545

","If you want to trigger a re-render after the ref changes, you must use useState instead of useRef . Only that way can you ensure that the component will re-render. E.g.: function Component() {  const [ref, setRef] = useState();  return <div ref={newRef => setRef(newRef)} />} As described under useRef documentation: Keep in mind that useRef doesn’t notify you when its content changes. Mutating the .current property doesn’t cause a re-render. If you want to run some code when React attaches or detaches a ref to a DOM node, you may want to use a callback ref instead.

Would it be at least as secure as a normal password?

","You can use source code as password. However I'd strongly recommend against using source code as a passphrase. The reason for this is entropy. Passwords / passwphrases need to provide lots of entropy (100 bits+) and programming languages usually pose severe constraints on the formulation of instruction thus resulting in less entropy per character than even with a standard passphrase.

Question:
In this Wikipedia article they have this to say about the gradient: If $m = 1$, $\mathbf{f}$ is a scalar field and the Jacobian matrix is reduced to a row vector of partial derivatives of $\mathbf{f}$—i.e. the gradient of $\mathbf{f}$. As well as The Jacobian of the gradient of a scalar function of several variables has a special name: the Hessian matrix, which in a sense is the ""second derivative"" of the function in question. So I tried doing the calculations, and was stumped. If we let $f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, then $$Df = \begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1} & \dots & \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}\end{bmatrix} = \nabla f$$So far so good, but when I try to calculate the Jacobian matrix of the gradient I get$$D^2f = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1^2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 x_1} & \dots & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n x_1} \\\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 x_2} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2^2} & \dots & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n x_2} \\\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_1 x_n} & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_2 x_n} & \dots & \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_n^2}\end{bmatrix}$$Which according to this article, is not equal to the Hessian matrix but rather its transpose, and from what I can gather the Hessian is not generally symmetric. So I have two questions, is the gradient generally thought of as a row vector? And did I do something wrong when I calculated the Jacobian of the gradient of $f$, or is the Wikipedia article incorrect?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You did not do anything wrong in your calculation.If you directly compute the Jacobian of the gradient of $f$ with the conventions you used, you will end up with the transpose of the Hessian.

The other Wikipedia article should probably update the language to match accordingly. As for the gradient of $f$ is being defined as a row vector, that is the way I have seen it more often, but it is noted https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_calculus#Layout_conventions that there are competing conventions for general matrix derivatives.However, I don't think that should change your answer for the Hessian- with the conventions you are using, you are correct that it should be transposed.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2053229', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/365294/']}",jdg_201418

Question:
I am aware that on a finite set the number of equivalence relations is the n-th Bell's Number . On the other hand, the only reference I could find on the web for infinite sets was this: On counting equivalence relations by D.J. Baylis, in which he proves that the set of equivalence relations on $\mathbb{N}$ is uncountable. I am interested in any sort of theorem that gives some rule about counting equivalence relations on an infinite set -something like $\beth_0 = \aleph_0$ and $\beth_n = 2^{\beth_{n-1}}$ - if there are any.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Firstly, to address Beth numbers (as you noted, the math markup doesn't work with them. I'll use words instead) $\beth$ (Beth) numbers are cardinal numbers defined as followed: $\beth_0 = \aleph_0$, $\beth_{\alpha+1} = 2^{\beth_n}$, $\beth_\delta=\sup_{\gamma<\delta}\beth_\gamma$, for a limit ordinal $\delta$. Now, given an infinite set $X$ and assuming the axiom of choice, we have that $|X\times X|=|X|$, therefore $|P(X\times X)| = |P(X)|$.Define $R(X)$ as the set of all equivalence relations on $X$, then clearly $R(X) \subset P(X\times X)$ and therefore $|R(X)| \le |P(X)|$. On the other hand there are $2^{|X|}$ partitions of $X$ into two sets (an easy exercise in cardinal arithmetic), so for every partition as such $\{X', X\setminus X'\}$ we can define an equivalence relation with two equivalence classes, namely $X'$ and its complement in $X$. Therefore $|R(X)| \ge |P(X)|$. All in all we have that the number of equivalence relations on $X$ is $2^{|X|}$.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3097', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/1415/']}",jdg_262319

","I'll talk about Spring and @Transactional but the advise applies for many other frameworks also. This is an inherent problem with proxy based aspects. It is discussed in the spring documentation here: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html#aop-understanding-aop-proxies There are a number of possible solutions. Refactor your classes to avoid the self-invocation calls that bypass the proxy. The Spring documentation describes this as ""The best approach (the term best is used loosely here)"" . Advantages of this approach are its simplicity and that there are no ties to any framework. However, it may not be appropriate for a very transactional heavy code base as you'd end up with many trivially small classes. Internally in the class get a reference to the proxy. This can be done by injecting the proxy or with hard coded "" AopContext.currentProxy()"" call (see Spring docs above.). This method allows you to avoid splitting the classes but in many ways negates the advantages of using the transactional annotation. My personal opinion is that this is one of those things that is a little ugly but the ugliness is self contained and might be the pragmatic approach if lots of transactions are used. Switch to using AspectJ As AspectJ does not use proxies then self-invocation is not a problem This is a very clean method though - it is at the expense of introducing another framework. I've worked on a large project where AspectJ was introduced for this very reason. Don't use @Transactional at all Refactor your code to use manual transaction demarcation - possibly using the decorator pattern. An option - but one that requires moderate refactoring, introducing additional framework ties and increased complexity - so probably not a preferred option My Advice Usually splitting up the code is the best answer and can also be good thing for seperation of concerns also. However, if I had a framework/application that heavily relied on nested transactions I would consider using AspectJ to allow self-invocation.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/8039042', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/204819/']}",jdg_122094

Question:
I'm interested in the effect of X on Y and want to adjust for confounding variables in my regression model. If the model (regression, F-test) is not significant but the predictor of which I'm interested in is, could I still report that there is an association between X and Y? So I just wanted to adjust for confounding variables but my interest is the relation between X and Y.Thank you. Lauren

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","One purpose of regression is to control for the effects of covariates.  This question is predicated on the (correct) understanding that this purpose should not be confused with testing the significance of those covariates. In a linear multiple regression model $$\mathbb{E}(y) = \alpha + \beta_1 x_1 + \cdots + \beta_k x_k,$$ the $F$ -test compares the null hypothesis $$H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \cdots = \beta_k = 0$$ to the alternative $$H_1: \beta_j \ne 0\text{ for at least one }j.$$ In your case, you're not interested in this hypothesis because most of those coefficients are associated with covariates.  Letting $j$ be the index of the single predictor in which you are interested and $n$ be the amount of data, your test should be based on comparing $$H_0: \beta_j = 0$$ to $$H_1: \beta_j \ne 0.$$ This is usually done with a t-test in which the estimate $\hat \beta_j$ is divided by its standard error $se(\hat\beta_j)$ and the resulting t-statistic is referred to the Student t distribution with $n-k-1$ degrees of freedom.  If you consider that result to be significant, then you will reject this null hypothesis (rather than the omnibus null hypothesis of the F test) and conclude that after controlling for all covariates, variable $x_j$ was found to be significantly associated with $y$ . Additional considerations Note that if you intended to conduct several such tests separately, involving several variables, then this procedure would no longer be correct for any one of them.  Context matters!  You would need first to perform a test to see whether any of that set of variables is significant.  The usual procedure is an F test based on the ""extra sum of squares"" associated with the variables of interest.  In the case of a single variable, this F test is mathematically equivalent to the Student t test. More subtly, note that what matters is the number of tests you planned to make before seeing the data.  If first you examined the data and then based on that examination you selected $x_j$ as the sole variable of interest, then you would somehow have to figure out how to account for the additional information you used in order to narrow the model down to this single variable.

Question:
Consider a connected symplectic manifold $(M, \omega)$ of dimension $m=2n$. A few preliminary reminders (mostly to fix the notation): A vector field $X$ is symplectic if its flow preserves the symplectic form, ie. $L_X \omega = 0$, where $L_X$ denotes Lie derivative with respect to $X$. The Cartan formula shows that this is equivalent to the 1-form $i_X\omega = \omega(X, -)$ being closed. The Hamiltonian vector field associated to a smooth function $f$ is the vector field determined by $\omega(X_f, -) = df$; any symplectic vector field is locally Hamiltonian. The questions I'm interested in are of local nature, so we don't have to worry about the distinction. Question 1: Which differential forms are invariant under all Hamiltonian flows (meaning $L_{X_f}\alpha = 0$ for all smooth functions $f$)? Clearly, the symplectic form itself generates a truncated polynomial algebra (isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}[x]/(x^{n+1})$) inside $\Omega^*(M)$ which is invariant under all Hamiltonian flows. But is it possible that there are other than those? I believe I have shown that there are no invariant 1-forms using a horrible calculation in local (Darboux) coordinates, but I'm not sure if this method is suitable for higher degrees. In the even degrees, we know that the answer is not 0, and I can't see how to prove that an invariant $2d$-form is necessarily a constant multiple of $\omega^d$. Question 2: What can one say about more general tensor fields on $M$? I am especially interested in the sections of the symmetric powers of $TM$ (ie. symmetric multi vector fields). The proof that no $1$-forms are invariant is easily adapted to proving that no vector fields are invariant, but again, I'm not sure if this generalizes. Question 3: Suppose we have a subalgebra $A\subset C^\infty(M)$ with the property that for each $p\in M$, $\{df_p \mid f\in A\} = T^*_pM$ (in other words, the Hamiltonian vector fields associated to the functions in $A$ realize every tangent vector on $M$). Do the answers to Questions 1 and 2 change if we only insist that the forms/tensor fields should be invariant under the Hamiltionian vector fields associated to the elements of $A$? It is certainly important that we still have a whole algebra of functions available; on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$, any constant coefficient tensor field is invariant under the Hamiltonian vector fields associated to the coordinate functions $x_j, y_j$ (which, up to a sign, are just the corresponding coordinate vector fields $\partial/\partial y_j, \partial/\partial x_j$). The proof that no invariant vector fields exists also requires one to consider the Hamiltonians associated to $x_j^2$ and $y_j^2$.

","Any symplectic linear transformations in $T_xM$ is locally realizable as a Hamiltonian vector field, thus for questions 1 and 2, one can profitably use representation theory of the symplectic group. FACT ( Lefschetz decomposition ) Let $W$ be a $2n$-dimensional symplectic vector space, $\bigwedge^\ast W$ its exterior algebra, and $\omega\in\bigwedge^2 W$ the invariant two-form. Exterior multiplication by $\omega$ and the contraction with $\omega$  define a pair of $Sp(W)$-equivariant graded linear transformations $L, \Lambda$ of $\bigwedge^\ast W$ into itself of degrees $2$ and $-2,$ and let $H=\deg-n$ be the graded degree $0$ map acting on $\bigwedge^k$ as multiplication by $k-n.$ Then $L,H,\Lambda$ form the standard basis of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl_2}$ acting on $\bigwedge^\ast W$ and the actions of $Sp(W)$ and $\mathfrak{sl_2}$ are the commutants of each other. See, for example, Roger Howe, Remarks on classical invariant theory . Corollary Every homogeneous $Sp(W)$-invariant element of $\bigwedge^\ast W$ is a multiple of $\omega^k$ for some $0\leq k\leq n.$ Since, conversely, every polynomial in $\omega$ is invariant under the Hamiltonian vector fields, this gives a full description of the invariant differential forms. For question 2, locally every invariant tensor must reduce to an $Sp(W)$-invariant element of the tensor algebra. For the special case of symmetric tensors, the answer is trivial. FACT Under the same assumptions, the $k$th symmetric power $S^k W$ is a simple $Sp(W)$-module (non-trivial for $k>0$). General case can be handled using similar considerations from classical invariant theory. A more involved question of describing the invariant local tensor operations on symplectic manifolds (an analogue of the well-known problem of invariant local operations on smooth manifolds, such as the exterior differential or Schoutens bracket) was considered in an old article by A.A.Kirillov.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://mathoverflow.net/questions/29907', 'https://mathoverflow.net', 'https://mathoverflow.net/users/4747/']}",jdg_278845

Question:
We all know that the block size in HDFS is pretty large (64M or 128M) as compared to the block size in traditional file systems. This is done in order to reduce the percentage of seek time compared to the transfer time (Improvements in transfer rate have been on a much larger scale than improvements on the disk seek time therefore, the goal while designing a file system is always to reduce the number of seeks in comparison to the amount of data to be transferred). But this comes with an additional disadvantage of internal fragmentation (which is why traditional file system block sizes are not so high and are only of the order of a few KBs - generally 4K or 8K). I was going through the book - Hadoop, the Definitive Guide and found this written somewhere that a file smaller than the block size of HDFS does not occupy the full block and does not account for the full block's space but couldn't understand how? Can somebody please throw some light on this.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The block division in HDFS is just logically built over the physical blocks of underlying file system (e.g. ext3/fat). The file system is not physically divided into blocks( say of 64MB or 128MB or whatever may be the block size). It's just an abstraction to store the metadata in the NameNode. Since the NameNode has to load the entire metadata in memory therefore there is a limit to number of metadata entries thus explaining the need for a large block size. Therefore, three 8MB files stored on HDFS logically occupies 3 blocks (3 metadata entries in NameNode) but physically occupies 8*3=24MB space in the underlying file system. The large block size is to account for proper usage of storage space while considering the limit on the memory of NameNode.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/13012924', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1416923/']}",jdg_289270

","const and static really do mean different things, different storage mechanism, different initialisation. static is read/write, therefore must have memory allocated for storage and must be initialised at runtime. A static can be initialised with a literal value or an expression. In contrast, a const is immutable and must be initialised with a compile time constant (typically a literal value, or an expression that can be fully evaluated at compile time). The value is known at compile time so it can be embedded directly in the generated code, therefore requires no storage to be allocated at runtime.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/842609', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/101095/']}",jdg_373422

Question:
As I was thinking about storing password hashes in a database, it dawned on me that there might be hash collisions if there is no set maximum length for the password being hashed. My understanding is that any password will generate a fixed-length hash (say 128bit). So, as soon as 2 128 + 1 unique passwords are used, then we have a collision (due to the pigeonhole principle ), while it is technically possible a collision occurs much sooner depending on the on the hash algorithm. Granted no collisions exist until the pingeonhole principle is satisfied, it seems rather absurd to have approximately 3.403e+38 unique passwords stored, so I can understand perhaps it is negligible to impose a password maximum. Is there a legitimate concern to not having a set maximum of characters for passwords (with regards to hash collisions)? This is related to this question .As mentioned by curiousguy , is it true that the ""impact of hash collisions is non existent""?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","For starters, hash functions are supposed to be basically random, so the length of the input string doesn't matter. The probability that two random 3-character strings hash to the same thing is the same as the probability that two random 100-character strings hash the same. For modern hash functions ( SHA1 , SHA2 , not MD5 ) their structure is mathematically complex enough that we can't say very much about it algebraically. Also, the space of possible input strings, even of length 32, is so huge that we can't experimentally check all of them. So, we don't actually know how many collisions there are within the first 2 128 strings (strings whose binary representation are 1 , 10 , 11 ... 2 128 ). In theory there should be some, but as far as I know, we haven't uncovered any yet for SHA1 or SHA2 . So your intuition that capping the length of the input strings to less than 2 128 bits will eliminate the risk of collisions isn't quite right. In any case, let's assume there are pairs of passwords within the first 2 128 strings that have the same hash, the probability that you will hit one in your database is roughly <number of entries in db> / 2 128 . The reason that the ""impact of hash collisions is non existent""? is that 1/  2 128 is such an unimaginably small number that even if you wrote a program to generate random passwords until the sun ran out of energy, you still wouldn't expect to see a single collision by random chance. (If someone's actively trying to do a collision attack, then that's a different story). Consider also how the risk of a collision (~ 1/2 128 ) compares to the risk of a standard dictionary attack. According to the 2013 Adobe password leak , 1 out of 68 accounts on the internet use the password 123456 . 1/68 is a MUCH bigger number than 1/2 128 , so the fact that a single guess of 123456 has a 1/68 chance of being right is a MUCH more important thing to worry about than theoretically-possible-collisions. Solution: allow (or enforce ) long non-dictionary passwords, use a unique salt for each password hash, and don't worry about collisions.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/108254', 'https://security.stackexchange.com', 'https://security.stackexchange.com/users/52634/']}",jdg_111182

Question:
Some Flash developers are afraid of JavaScript. Their point of view: Stealing JS source code is effortless, one would just 'view source' and copy it. Yes, you can decompile Flash bytecode, however it requires more time and knowledge. As a result, JavaScript is not suitable for commercial software development, because competitors will steal the code and put the original developer out of business.

They obfuscate to minimize the size of the code, in order to reduce the download size and minimize the page load times.  (See the Google Closure Compiler .)

Question:

StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml(stringBody); I know from api doc what escapeHtml does.here is the example given:- For example: ""bread"" & ""butter""becomes: &quot;bread&quot; &amp; &quot;butter&quot;.

But i am not getting why and when it is required and what happens if we send the string body without escaping html? what is the cost if we dont do escapeHtml before sending it to browser

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I can think of several possibilities to explain why sometimes a string is not escaped: perhaps the original programmer was confident that at certain places the string had no special characters (however, in my opinion this would be bad programming practice; it costs very little to escape a string as protection against future changes) the string was already escaped at that point in the code. You definitely don't want to escape a string twice; the user will end up seeing the escape sequence instead of the intended text. The string was the actual html itself. You don't want to escape the html; you want the browser to process it! EDIT - The reason for escaping is that special characters like & and < can end up causing the browser to display something other than what you intended. A bare & is technically an error in the html. Most browsers try to deal intelligently with such errors and will display them correctly in most cases. (This will almost certainly happen in your example text if the string were text in a <div> , for instance.) However, because it is bad markup, some browsers will not work well; assistive technologies (e.g., text-to-speech) may fail; and there may be other problems. There are several cases that will fail despite the best efforts of the browser to recover from bad markup. If your sample string were an attribute value, escaping the quote marks would be absolutely required. There's no way that a browser is going to correctly handle something like: <img alt=""""bread"" & ""butter"""" ... > The general rule is that any character that is not markup but might be confused as markup need to be escaped. Note that there are several contexts in which text can appear within an html document, and they have separate requirements for escaping. The following should be escaped: all characters that have no representation in the character set of the document (unlikely if you are using UTF-8, but that's not always the case) Within attribute values, quote marks ( ' or "" , whichever one matches the delimiters used for the attribute value itself) and the ampersand ( & ), but not < Within text nodes, only & and < Within href values, characters that need escaping in a url (and sometimes these need to be doubly escaped so they are still escaped after the browser unescapes them once) Within a CDATA block, generally nothing (at the HTML level). Finally, aside from the hazard of double-escaping, the cost of escaping all text is minimal: a tiny bit of extra processing and a few extra bytes on the network.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/14765766', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/802050/']}",jdg_224957

It also sends the following action when selected: - (IBAction)toggleWordWrap:(id)sender {    NSUserDefaultsController *ctrlr = [NSUserDefaultsController sharedUserDefaultsController];    if ([[[ctrlr values] valueForKey:@""wordWrapIsEnabled""] boolValue]) {        // turn on word wrap    } else {        // turn off word wrap    }} In my app delegate's +initialize method, I populate the standard user defaults with default values: + (void)initializeDefaults {    NSDictionary *defaults = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys:                             [NSNumber numberWithBool:NO], @""wordWrapIsEnabled"",                             // etc.                             nil];    NSUserDefaultsController *ctrlr = [NSUserDefaultsController sharedUserDefaultsController];    [ctrlr setInitialValues:defaults];} My problem is that my NSMenuItem's state is not staying in sync with my user defaults. Here is a timeline of what happens: App launch: Word Wrap menu item not checked wordWrapIsEnabled is NO Word wrap is OFF 1st time Word Wrap is selected: Word Wrap menu item checked wordWrapIsEnabled is NO (BZZZT WRONG) Word wrap is OFF (BZZZT WRONG) 2nd time Word Wrap is selected: Word Wrap menu item not checked wordWrapIsEnabled is YES (BZZZT WRONG) Word Wrap is ON (BZZZT WRONG) Repeat flip-flop ad infinitum. I've checked to make sure there is nothing else in my project that accesses wordWrapIsEnabled . Could there be a race condition between the invocation of the selector and the setting of wordWrapIsEnabled via the binding? I've been assuming that the bound value gets set first.

","When you click a menu item with a bound state (or value ) property, the menu item both triggers its action and flips the bound value. And the order of these two operations does not seem to be guaranteed, see the following thread on Cocoa Builder : Thanks, I am not absolutely sure  because I did several changes in my  project but I think that this can be  considered a bug of 10.5 sdk, because  it started to happen when I  started  to compile for it. The (almost) same  project when it was targeted for Tiger  always changed the bound value before the target-action was executed, regardless if it was a  button or a menuItem. Apparently this  consistency has been broken in  Leopard. I may post a bug report after  some testing to confirm it. There’s also a related Radar bug report saying that menu items should not flip the bound value automatically.

Question:
How can I define conditional array elements?I want to do something like this: const cond = true;const myArr = [""foo"", cond && ""bar""]; This works as expected and results in [""foo"", ""bar""] but if I set cond to false , I get the following result: [""foo"", false] How can I define an array with a conditional element?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You can spread an array inside of an array, in order to keep items array clean, when the condition is false . Here's how you can do it : // Will result in ['foo', 'bar']const items = [  'foo',  ... true ? ['bar'] : [],  ... false ? ['falsy'] : [],]console.log(items) Explanations : As you can see the ternary operator always returns an array. If the condition is true , then it returns ['bar'] , otherwise an empty array [] . After that we spread out ... the resulted array (from the ternary operation) and the array's items are pushed to the parent array. If there aren't any array items (when the ternary check is false ), then nothing will be pushed, which is our goal. In other answer I explained the same idea, but for objects.

Question:
Does python have anything similar to a sealed class? I believe it's also known as final class, in java. In other words, in python, can we mark a class so it can never be inherited or expanded upon? Did python ever considered having such a feature? Why? Disclaimers Actually trying to understand why sealed classes even exist. Answer here (and in many , many , many , many , many , really many other places) did not satisfy me at all, so I'm trying to look from a different angle. Please, avoid theoretical answers to this question, and focus on the title! Or, if you'd insist, at least please give one very good and practical example of a sealed class in csharp, pointing what would break big time if it was unsealed. I'm no expert in either language, but I do know a bit of both. Just yesterday while coding on csharp I got to know about the existence of sealed classes. And now I'm wondering if python has anything equivalent to that. I believe there is a very good reason for its existence, but I'm really not getting it.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You can use a metaclass to prevent subclassing: class Final(type):    def __new__(cls, name, bases, classdict):        for b in bases:            if isinstance(b, Final):                raise TypeError(""type '{0}' is not an acceptable base type"".format(b.__name__))        return type.__new__(cls, name, bases, dict(classdict))class Foo:    __metaclass__ = Finalclass Bar(Foo):    pass gives: >>> class Bar(Foo):...     pass... Traceback (most recent call last):  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>  File ""<stdin>"", line 5, in __new__TypeError: type 'Foo' is not an acceptable base type The __metaclass__ = Final line makes the Foo class 'sealed'. Note that you'd use a sealed class in .NET as a performance measure; since there won't be any subclassing methods can be addressed directly. Python method lookups work very differently, and there is no advantage or disadvantage, when it comes to method lookups, to using a metaclass like the above example.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/16564198', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/274502/']}",jdg_266697

Question:
I have a list of integers and I need to count how many of them are > 0. I'm currently doing it with a list comprehension that looks like this: sum([1 for x in frequencies if x > 0]) It seems like a decent comprehension but I don't really like the ""1""; it seems like a bit of a magic number.  Is there a more Pythonish way to do this?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","If you want to reduce the amount of memory, you can avoid generating a temporary list by using a generator: sum(x > 0 for x in frequencies) This works because bool is a subclass of int : >>> isinstance(True,int)True and True 's value is 1: >>> True==1True However, as Joe Golton points out in the comments, this solution is not very fast. If you have enough memory to use a intermediate temporary list, then sth's solution may be faster. Here are some timings comparing various solutions: >>> frequencies = [random.randint(0,2) for i in range(10**5)]>>> %timeit len([x for x in frequencies if x > 0])   # sth100 loops, best of 3: 3.93 ms per loop>>> %timeit sum([1 for x in frequencies if x > 0])100 loops, best of 3: 4.45 ms per loop>>> %timeit sum(1 for x in frequencies if x > 0)100 loops, best of 3: 6.17 ms per loop>>> %timeit sum(x > 0 for x in frequencies)100 loops, best of 3: 8.57 ms per loop Beware that timeit results may vary depending on version of Python, OS, or hardware. Of course, if you are doing math on a large list of numbers, you should probably be using NumPy: >>> frequencies = np.random.randint(3, size=10**5)>>> %timeit (frequencies > 0).sum()1000 loops, best of 3: 669 us per loop The NumPy array requires less memory than the equivalent Python list, and the calculation can be performed much faster than any pure Python solution.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2900084', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/122808/']}",jdg_271060

Question:
I recently came across the notion of a scale free network, see Scale Free Network . These networks tend to have power-law distributions. I was wondering if reputation in SE was distributed like this, but can't find the overall stats for reputation anywhere. I see things like ""top 4% this year"" on people's pages, so I'm guessing the stats exist somewhere, but are they accessible by all? Update (1): Thanks to the commenters, it looks like we have a power law indeed. The shape seems to match the cumulative distribution function as found on Wikipedia: Cumulative Power-Law Distribution . Now the question is, what is the exponent? Update (2): Due to a thorough answer below by apnorton, we have our best-fit exponent! It's −1.701. This is very interesting. It would imply that there is no well defined mean or variance for reputation*, because according to the Wikipedia page for power laws , the mean is only defined for exponents whose absolute value is greater than $2$ and variance is only defined if the same is greater than $3$. This makes sense when one considers the harmonic series divergence. *Of course, there will be a mean and variance because the sample is finite, but in the infinite limit, these values will not converge if the power law indeed holds.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As mentioned in comments, I made a Data.SE query that gave the cumulative distribution of users by reputation.  However, we're interested in the distribution (not cumulative).  So, I wrote a quick program in Python (or, at least, it would have been quick if I knew how to use the scipy toolkit before this) to compute the ""derivative"" of this CDF.  The interesting plots are below: Distribution The most glaring oddity here is the two ""starting descents.""  After a little thought, this is an expected result of the association bonus.  I've truncated the tail of the plot (only going to reputation = 1000) because it is similar and not very illuminating. Log-Log plot This is the same as above, but with the axes using a log-log scale.  This is nearly linear, which suggests a power law distribution.  It's a bit ""top heavy"" towards the end--if I'm interpreting this correctly, that means users are ""slowing down""/""clumping"" in their reputation as they reach higher and higher reputation values.  I'm not exactly sure, but this could be related to the 200 rep cap (if users can't gain rep freely, we'd expect a ""clump"" of users with approximately the same reputation that slowly moves further to the right and down). I'm not really familiar with this type of math, so if I've made a mistake, please point it out. :)  Also, I have yet to figure out how to make a best fit line (and, hence, the exponent) using the scipy toolkit... I'll see about doing so after I complete some homework.  The Python 3 program I wrote to generate these plots can be found here . Update So, I finally got around to doing a best-fit line.  This was done by performing linear regression the log-log data (e.g. I found a linear relationship between the log of R and the log of U).  I ignored the datapoints below the 101 rep-value cutoff (as mentioned in the comments, including it would introduce unnecessary error).  The slope of this line was $-1.701$ and the intercept was $12.707$ .  Since I've been using $U$ to designate the cumulative users, we have: $$\frac{dU}{dR} \approx \exp(12.707)\cdot R^{-1.701}$$ Thus, we know our exponent.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/21259', 'https://math.meta.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/users/252983/']}",jdg_245582

Question:
Working on an idea for a simple HTMLElement wrapper I stumbled upon the following for Internet Explorer and Chrome : For a given HTMLElement with an id in the DOM tree, it is possible to retrieve the <div> using its ID as a variable name or as a property of window . So for a <div> like <div id=""example"">some text</div> in Internet Explorer 8 and Chrome you can do: alert(example.innerHTML); // Alerts ""some text"". or alert(window[""example""].innerHTML); // Alerts ""some text"". So, does this mean every element in the DOM tree is converted to a property on the global object? And does it also mean one can use this as a replacement for the getElementById method in these browsers?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","What is supposed to happen is that ‘named elements’ are added as apparent properties of the document object. This is a really bad idea, as it allows element names to clash with real properties of document . IE made the situation worse by also adding named elements as properties of the window object. This is doubly bad in that now you have to avoid naming your elements after any member of either the document or the window object you (or any other library code in your project) might want to use. It also means that these elements are visible as global-like variables. Luckily in this case any real global var or function declarations in your code shadow them, so you don't need to worry so much about naming here, but if you try to do an assignment to a global variable with a clashing name and you forget to declare it var , you'll get an error in IE as it tries to assign the value to the element itself. It's generally considered bad practice to omit var , as well as to rely on named elements being visible on window or as globals. Stick to document.getElementById , which is more widely-supported and less ambiguous. You can write a trivial wrapper function with a shorter name if you don't like the typing. Either way, there's no point in using an id-to-element lookup cache, because browsers typically optimise the getElementById call to use a quick lookup anyway; all you get is problems when elements change id or are added/removed from the document. Opera copied IE, then WebKit joined in, and now both the previously-unstandardised practice of putting named elements on document properties, and the previously-IE-only practice of putting them on window are being standardised by HTML5, whose approach is to document and standardise every terrible practice inflicted on us by browser authors, making them part of the web forever. So Firefox 4 will also support this. What are ‘named elements’? Anything with an id , and anything with a name being used for ‘identifying’ purposes: that is, forms, images, anchors and a few others, but not other unrelated instances of a name attribute, like control-names in form input fields, parameter names in <param> or metadata type in <meta> . ‘Identifying’ name s are the ones that should be avoided in favour of id .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 10, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3434278', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/58186/']}",jdg_298263

Question:
I'm trying to fit a 2D Gaussian to an image. Noise is very low, so my attempt was to rotate the image such that the two principal axes do not co-vary, figure out the maximum and just compute the standard deviation in both dimensions. Weapon of choice is python. However I got stuck at finding the eigenvectors of the image - numpy.linalg.py assumes discrete data points. I thought about taking this image to be a probability distribution, sampling a few thousand points and then computing the eigenvectors from that distribution, but I'm sure there must be a way of finding the eigenvectors (ie., semi-major and semi-minor axes of the gaussian ellipse) directly from that image. Any ideas? Thanks a lot :)

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Just a quick note, there are several tools to fit a gaussian to an image.  The only thing I can think of off the top of my head is scikits.learn , which isn't completely image-oriented, but I know there are others. To calculate the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix exactly as you had in mind is very computationally expensive. You have to associate each pixel (or a large-ish random sample) of image with an x,y point. Basically, you do something like: import numpy as np    # grid is your image data, here...    grid = np.random.random((10,10))    nrows, ncols = grid.shape    i,j = np.mgrid[:nrows, :ncols]    coords = np.vstack((i.reshape(-1), j.reshape(-1), grid.reshape(-1))).T    cov = np.cov(coords)    eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eigh(cov) You can instead make use of the fact that it's a regularly-sampled image and compute it's moments (or ""intertial axes"") instead.

The scenario is a set of HTTP requests, the number and type of which is determined by the results of the first HTTP request. I'd like to do this simply. I have also seen this answer which suggests something like this: var q = require('q'),    itemsToProcess =  [""one"", ""two"", ""three"", ""four"", ""five""];function getDeferredResult(prevResult) {  return (function (someResult) {    var deferred = q.defer();    // any async function (setTimeout for now will do, $.ajax() later)    setTimeout(function () {      var nextResult = (someResult || ""Initial_Blank_Value "") + "".."" + itemsToProcess[0];      itemsToProcess = itemsToProcess.splice(1);      console.log(""tick"", nextResult, ""Array:"", itemsToProcess);      deferred.resolve(nextResult);    }, 600);    return deferred.promise;  }(prevResult));}var chain = q.resolve(""start"");for (var i = itemsToProcess.length; i > 0; i--) {    chain = chain.then(getDeferredResult);} ...but it seems awkward to loop through the itemsToProcess in that way.

Question:
I have a Mitsubishi Lancer (but I don't live in USA, so it's not the same sold in America), and the manual says to inflate tires to 31 psi. Now I'll be replacing my tires with ones from a different brand/model, which is rated by some costumers to be quieter, softer (less vibration from the road transferred to the car) and with a slightly smaller grip (but since I don't use it to the limits, I think it's ok). Since they have some characteristics that are different from the original tire, how much should I inflate? The original recommended pressure (31 psi) applies only to the same tire, or it's a characteristic of the vehicle (and should be used no matter what tire I use) ?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","tl;dr : The recommended pressure is almost always a good general recommendation.  You can make adjustments to suit your specific needs. The original recommended pressure (31 psi) applies only to the same  tire, or it's a characteristic of the vehicle (and should be used no  matter what tire I use) ? As a first step, I'm going to point you at Tire Rack's excellent discussions on tire pressures and a whole host of other technical topics. 31 psi is a reasonable starting pressure on your vehicle, regardless of the specific tire that you put on it. Let's quickly consider some of the factors that the air in the tires affects: It acts as a spring .  We don't drive on solid rubber tires for a reason: these are much more comfortable. It defines the tire's shape .  More air => taller tire with a smaller contact patch.  Less air => shorter tire with a larger contact patch. It defines the tire's stiffness , especially in terms of the sidewalls.  An underinflated tire is going to roll over its sidewall in a hard turn, wearing out the side and edge.  A well-inflated tire will hold its shape, keeping a more defined contact patch on the road. Now let's talk about examples of where we'd potentially like to adjust our tire pressures.  Note: all of the factors below assume that you're tuning by relatively modest amounts (e.g., plus or minus 10%).  So when I say ""more air,"" I don't mean 100psi, and ""less air"" is not the same as saying ""zero air."" A front engine car is heavier in the front than it is in the rear.  It is common to see a higher tire pressure in the front partially as a consequence of this increased load. Street cars are generally set up with a bias towards understeer.  Lower tire pressures in the rear will increase grip on the back end, reducing the chance that it will swing around on a casual driver. A tire is an undamped spring (i.e., no shock absorber).  A high tire pressure will transmit more of the bumps and jolts of a lower quality road directly to the driver. This factor increases in importance in proportion to the annoyance of the spouse in the passenger seat. A tire with less air will generally have more grip in all respects.  This means that it will feel less responsive to sudden steering adjustments.  A small drop (e.g., 2 psi) is common to increase winter traction where real snow accumulation is common and persistant (i.e., not where I live). A severe drop in pressure will cause the sidewalls to bulge out significantly and dramatically increasing the footprint of the tire.  This can be used to get out of a deep hole in the snow.  You can see a practical example of this technique in the Top Gear Polar Special . A tire with more air will have a smaller contact patch and stiffer sidewalls, generally leading to increased fuel economy. In short, tuning the tire pressures is the absolute cheapest way to adjust your suspension performance. Nitpick: yes, I know that it's not the air alone that's acting as a spring.  It's the combination of the air, rubber, belts and the deformation that happens under an impact.  For an introductory discussion, though, we can say ""air = spring.""",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/8006', 'https://mechanics.stackexchange.com', 'https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/2107/']}",jdg_70716

Question:
Is orientation change handling is as simple as widget's build is rerun with the updated dimensions in Flutter? I ask because in Android, the whole Activity is rebuilt, which is why all the information is sent via intents. Any gotchas to keep in mind while designing widgets so they will handle orientation changes or other changes that result in UI to change?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Basically - yes!  Now, more specifically the MediaQuery widget listens for orientation/size/layout changes and rebuilds it's children. This widget is already a part of the MaterialApp and WidgetsApp widget so you probably don't need to include it. If you want your widget to take advantage of the device orientation, you can use the MediaQuery.of static member to access a MediaQueryData , which contains the device orientation. For example, a simple widget which displays different text in portrait and landscape (needs to be the child of MaterialApp , WidgetsApp , or MediaQuery ). class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {  Widget build(BuildContext context) {    final mediaQueryData = MediaQuery.of(context);    if (mediaQueryData.orientation == Orientation.landscape) {      return const Text('landscape');    }    return const Text('portrait!');  }}",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/49663494', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/284624/']}",jdg_137917

Question:
class Person(val name:String,var age:Int )def person = new Person(""Kumar"",12)person.age = 20println(person.age) These lines of code outputs 12 , even though person.age=20 was successfully executed. I found that this happens because I used def in def person = new Person(""Kumar"",12) . If I use var or val the output is 20 . I understand the default is val in scala. This: def age = 30age = 45 ...gives a compilation error because it is a val by default. Why do the first set of lines above not work properly, and yet also don't error?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","There are three ways of defining things in Scala: def defines a method val defines a fixed value (which cannot be modified) var defines a variable (which can be modified) Looking at your code: def person = new Person(""Kumar"",12) This defines a new method called person . You can call this method only without () because it is defined as parameterless method. For empty-paren method, you can call it with or without '()'. If you simply write: person then you are calling this method (and if you don't assign the return value, it will just be discarded). In this line of code: person.age = 20 what happens is that you first call the person method, and on the return value (an instance of class Person ) you are changing the age member variable. And the last line: println(person.age) Here you are again calling the person method, which returns a new instance of class Person (with age set to 12).

I'm building a small vb app using the latest version of the .net compact framework.  The datagrid control is a bit more limited than I'm used to. I'm seeing lots of examples where I can bind the grid's datasource to a dataset/datatable.  Is it possible to bind to a generic list?  If so, how?

","Your migration would have worked if there would not be any record in your individual_trainings table.

But replicate 100 (product (map (*3) (zipWith (max [1,2,3,4,5] [4,5,6,7,8])))) does not work. It is because I put a set of brackets for zipWith.

Question:
I have a ViewGroup that programmatically instantiates and assigns an ID to a ViewPager.  On rotation, the ""Up"" button and changing the screen orientation will recreate the Views -- but it doesn't remember the last page index of the ViewPager. I've verified that OnSaveInstanceState() and OnRestoreInstanceState() are both being called, and both of them contain the correct page index information.  But, the ViewPager gets reset to page index to 0 regardless.  I notice that I get I message in the console No package identifier when getting name for resource number [id that I programmatically defined] As an experiment, I defined the ViewPager (along with the ID) in XML.  It does correctly set the ViewPager to the last page index. So, what I suspect is that the Android framework can't actually restore the last state correctly because the ID doesn't persist when the ViewGroup then ViewPager gets destroyed. How can I get this to work?  I'd like to contain all state relating things within this ViewGroup (eg avoid keeping track of the ViewPager position in Fragment).  But, it doesn't seem like I can get this to work unless I can make the ID persist (if that's the root cause).

Should I copy the different file types in to their corresponding assets/javascripts/ , assets/stylesheets/ , etc. subfolders?

I've heard the term ""Tickless OS"" thrown around. What does it mean? Which OSes are tickless? How does it differ from a non-tickless (tickful?) OS?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","A 'tick' in OS terms is an interval after which the OS will wake up to process any pending events. So, if you have a 100Hz tick, then 100 times a second, the OS will wake up, check to see whether any timers have expired, execute their actions if there are, then go to sleep again.  On a tick-less system, rather than waking up 100 times a second to see if anything is ready to process, the OS will look at when the next timer is due to expire and then sleep until that time. Note that when the CPU is active, it's obviously not going to go into any kind of sleep mode, and the kernel will set up an interrupt for scheduling purposes.  It's only tickless (as the comment points out) when there's nothing running on the CPU or (in very modern Linux kernels) when only one process is running. Linux can run with or without ticks, with a compile-time switch.  I don't know about any other systems.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/1265020', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1084/']}",jdg_273028

Question:
I have a 2002 Audi A4 Quattro 3.0. I have a Vagcom USB cable and I am trying to diagnose the MAF sensor. I had a friend get some readings from an OBD2 scanner, which indicated that both precat O2 sensors (passenger side and driver side) had negative values. He said that it probably isn't the O2 sensors, since both of them are reading similar readings. He also said it is possibly the MAF sensor or a vacuum leak somewhere. I have taken these readings from the MAF sensor. It appears that the ""grams per second"" is not going above 50, even when the engine is revving at 7000 rpm. Does this indicate that the MAF is faulty? Is there anything else I can do to see if this really is the problem? I have found this PDF: http://www.ross-tech.net/vag-com/advertising/DiagnosingA_MAF_TechTip.pdf Which indicates that this value should peak at about 160 g/s in a 200 horse power car. However, the altitude could be a factor in calculating this. I am located in Denver Colorado, roughly mile above sea level. Any advice would be a massive help, UPDATE: I wanted to add that the CEL's that came on are P0171 and P0174. I have tried spraying the MAF sensor with MAF Sensor cleaner that I got from Autozone, it didn't seem to make any difference, but I possibly didn't clean it properly? I took the sensor off an sprayed it all over, let it dry, and then popped it back in.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The 50 g/s max flow reading that you are getting is far lower than what merely altitude can explain. The chart above shows that at about 5,200 ft above sea level, the density of air is 83% of what it is at sea level (0.062 lb/cu.ft vs. .075 lb/cu.ft). So to account for the altitude, you should multiply your expected mass flow by 0.83.According to the VAG-COM diagnosis guide, which I have no reason to doubt, a 200bhp naturally-aspirated engine should flow about 160g/s of air at full-throttle peak power when at sea level. Therefore, at 5,200 ft above sea level, it should flow 160 g/s * 0.83 = 133 g/s. You're seeing 50 g/s. You're certianly not metering enough air through the MAF. This could be a MAF failure, or a big leak after the MAF.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/questions/7954', 'https://mechanics.stackexchange.com', 'https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/users/4123/']}",jdg_353029

Question:
Seeing toroids wound like this is somewhat common in the amateur radio hobby to reduce common-mode current on an antenna feedline: Why the cross over the middle? As far as I can tell, all the turns go around the core in the same direction. Why not just keep winding all the way around? Sometimes they are also seen with two enameled wires instead of coax: Is this any different? As far as I can tell, it's effectively a common-mode choke in both cases. Does the cross over in the middle serve any purpose?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","This is an RF split-wound balun. Moving the windings apart is intended to reduce capacitance between input and output. As this says: Some articles and handbooks show a Split winding method. This method is supposed to reduce winding capacitance by moving the ends of windings further apart.

","You don't specify the environment, so here's the answer (found elsewhere on this site: How do I solve ldap_start_tls() ""Unable to start TLS: Connect error"" in PHP? ): Linux: on the client machine (PHP web server) modify the ldap.conf file that the systems is using, in RH/Fedora the file you want is /etc/openldap/ldap.conf ( not /etc/ldap.conf , that is for system authentication... ) .  Add/modify the following line: TLS_REQCERT never Windows: Add a system environment variable like the following: LDAPTLS_REQCERT=never Or in your PHP code, before the ldap_connect, put the following: putenv('LDAPTLS_REQCERT=never'); These will insure the client web server PHP instance never checks the FQDN of the server against the CN (common name) of the certificate.  Very helpful in cluster environments where a virtual IP and certificate for that is used.  But since this also makes it so that the other tools/applications in the entire OS on the web server machine will not check this either, please insure that your environment allows this change (high-security environments might not allow it).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3866406', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/223520/']}",jdg_327015

Question:
Find all natural numbers $n$ such that $2^n$ divides $3^n -1$ I think that the only solutions are $n = 0,1,2,4$, but I have no idea on how to prove it. I tried to write $3^n-1$ as $1+3+3^2+...+3^{n-1}$ and manipulate the sum but found my self at the equally hard problem of finding the power of two dividing $3^k+1$

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Well $3^n - 1 = (3-1)(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1}) = 2(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1})$ So $2^n|3^n - 1$ if and only if $2^{n-1}|(1 + 3 + 3^2 + ... + 3^{n-1})$. If $n$ is odd and greater than one $(1+3 + 3^2 + .... + 3^{n-1})$ is odd so we can assume $n$ is even. Let $n = 2m$ then $2^{2m}|3^{2m} - 1=(3^m -1)(3^m+1)$.  So $3^m \pm 1$ are both even and only one of them is is divisible by $4$. So $2^{2m-1}|3^m \pm 1$ so $2^{2m-1} \le 3^m \pm 1$. But $2^{2m-1} = \frac 12*4^{m} \le 3^m \pm 1$ So $(\frac 43)^m \le 2 \pm \frac 2{3^m} < 2\frac 23$ If $m \ge 3$ then $(\frac 43)^m \ge 2 \frac {10}{27} > 2 \frac 2{3^3}\ge 2 + \frac 2{3^m}$ So $m < 3$ So if $n > 1$ then $n= 2m; m\le 2$. So solutions must be a subset of $\{0,1,2,4\}$. And you have already determined that $\{0,1,2,4\}$ are all solutions. ==== There's probably a more elegant way. My first thought was FTL that as $\gcd(3, 2^n) = 1$ and $\phi(2^n) = 2^{n-1}$ then $3^{2^{n-1}}\equiv 1 \mod 2^n$. So If $3^m \equiv 1 \mod 2^n$ then $m$ is a multiple of a non-trivial factor of $2^{n-1}$ .i.e. even but that didn't really get me closer. Likewise $3^n = (2 + 1)^n = 2^n + \sum{n\choose k} 2^k$ and for $2^n|\sum{n\choose k} 2^k$ seemed like it should yeild something relevent but I wasn't able to put my finger on it exactly. Similarly $3^n = (4 -1)^n$. Its a enough to convince me the answers are related to powers of $2$ but not enough to actually prove it.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2563956', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/-1/']}",jdg_212301

","A couple points: Apple recommends that you use WKWebview for iOS 8 and later. I would avoid writing new code with UIWebView . In apps that run in iOS 8 and later, use the WKWebView class instead of using UIWebView . Additionally, consider setting the WKPreferences property javaScriptEnabled to false if you render files that are not supposed to run JavaScript. Apple has been trying to move away from path and instead wants to use URI even for local files. They recommend that you NOT use /path/to/file.png and use file:///path/to/file.png instead. As to why one URL works and the other does not, let's make a minimal example: let realPath = ""/path/to/file.png""let url = URL(string: realPath)               // /path/to/file.pnglet fileUrl = URL(fileURLWithPath: realPath)  // file:///path/to/file.png url does not provide the scheme (a.k.a protocol). It should only be used in conjunction with another URL to give the absolute address of the resource you are trying to reach. UIWebView supports it for backwards-compatibility reasons but Apple decided to start clean with WKWebView . fileURL has a scheme ( file:// ) that tells the resource is located on the local file system. Other common schemes are http , https , ftp , etc. It's a complete address to a resource so both views know how to resolve it.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/41134493', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2018221/']}",jdg_377267

Question:
I came across this Snopes page recently, which presents the claim that the astronauts aboard the Space Shuttle Challenger survived until the crew compartment hit the water, and then debunks it. If the cabin depressurized immediately, the crew would have lived about 6 to 15 seconds after the blast; if not, they might have survived for the full two minutes and forty-five seconds it took the cabin to fall 65,000 feet back to Earth. They most certainly could not have lived through the crushing 207 mph impact with the waters off the Florida coast, which negates the wilder versions of ""survived astronauts"" rumors that had them still alive for hours (and even days) under the sea, waiting for rescuers who could not reach them in time. While the arguments presented against the claim sound fairly good (especially considering that the ""tape"" was from a tabloid), I'd like some more assessments. How long did the astronauts stay alive? Were some alive when the crew compartment hit the water?

","In summary; The cause of death of the Challenger astronauts cannot be positively determined; The forces to which the crew were exposed during orbiter breakup were probably not sufficient to cause death or serious injury; and The crew possibly, but not certainly, lost consciousness in the seconds following orbiter breakup due to in-flight loss of crew module pressure. source The crew compartment was only destroyed by hitting the water, roughly 200 seconds after the initial breakup of Challenger source The official report of the Challenger disaster can be found in the Report of the PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION on the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident , however the pertinent part can be found in Appendix O : NASA Search, Recovery and Reconstruction Task Force Team Report The structural evaluation established clearly that the crew module, including most of its outer shell, remained essentially intact until impact with the water and that the module was fragmented extensively from extreme overload and inertial forces associated with water impact. The structural deformations and fragmentations indicate that the module struck the water in a slight nose down and steep left bank attitude. Additionally, there is evidence that 3 crew members activated their personal egress air pack (PEAP) indicating that there was a period of consciousness post-incident: The separation of the crew compartment deprived the crew of Orbiter-supplied oxygen, except for a few seconds supply in the lines. Each crew member's helmet was also connected to a personal egress air pack (PEAP) containing an emergency supply of breathing air (not oxygen) for ground egress emergencies, which must be manually activated to be available. Four PEAP's were recovered, and there is evidence that three had been activated. source An estimate of the length of time for the crew module to hit the water after the incident is therefore the best estimate of how long they survived. Several large objects were tracked by radar after the shuttle disintegrated. One such object, classified as ""Object D,"" hit the water 207 seconds after launch about 18 nautical miles east of launch pad 39B. This apparently was the crew cabin source There is a haunting image included in the report, the lower of the 3 arrows indicating the intact crew compartment separating from the left wing (top arrow) and main engine (center arrow)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/23675', 'https://skeptics.stackexchange.com', 'https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/users/22247/']}",jdg_365640

Question:
Is it a good practice to use sigmoid or tanh output layers in Neural networks directly to estimate probabilities? i.e the probability of given input to occur is the output of sigmoid function in the NN EDIT I wanted to use neural network to learn and predict the probability of a given input to occur..You may consider the input as State1-Action-State2 tuple.Hence the output of NN is the probability that State2 happens when applying Action on State1.. I Hope that does clear things.. EDIT When training NN, I do random Action on State1 and observe resultant State2; then teach NN that input State1-Action-State2 should result in output 1.0

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","First, just a couple of small points on the conventional MLP lexicon (might help for internet searches, etc.): 'sigmoid' and 'tanh' are not 'output layers' but functions, usually referred to as ""activation functions"". The return value of the activation function is indeed the output from each layer, but they are not the output layer themselves (nor do they calculate probabilities). Additionally, your question recites a choice between two ""alternatives"" (""sigmoid and tanh""), but they are not actually alternatives, rather the term 'sigmoidal function' is a generic/informal term for a class of functions, which includes the hyperbolic tangent ('tanh') that you refer to. The term 'sigmoidal' is probably due to the characteristic shape of the function--the return (y) values are constrained between two asymptotic values regardless of the x value. The function output is usually normalized so that these two values are -1 and 1 (or 0 and 1). (This output behavior, by the way, is obviously inspired by the biological neuron which either fires (+1) or it doesn't (-1)). A look at the key properties of sigmoidal functions and you can see why they are ideally suited as activation functions in feed-forward, backpropagating neural networks: (i) real-valued and differentiable, (ii) having exactly one inflection point, and (iii) having a pair of horizontal asymptotes. In turn, the sigmoidal function is one category of functions used as the activation function (aka ""squashing function"") in FF neural networks solved using backprop. During training or prediction, the weighted sum of the inputs (for a given layer, one layer at a time) is passed in as an argument to the activation function which returns the output for that layer. Another group of functions apparently used as the activation function is piecewise linear function. The step function is the binary variant of a PLF: def step_fn(x) :  if x <= 0 :    y = 0  if x > 0 :    y = 1 (On practical grounds, I doubt the step function is a plausible choice for the activation function, but perhaps it helps understand the purpose of the activation function in NN operation.) I suppose there an unlimited number of possible activation functions, but in practice, you only see a handful; in fact just two account for the overwhelming majority of cases (both are sigmoidal). Here they are (in python) so you can experiment for yourself, given that the primary selection criterion is a practical one: # logistic functiondef sigmoid2(x) :  return 1 / (1 + e**(-x))   # hyperbolic tangentdef sigmoid1(x) :  return math.tanh(x) what are the factors to consider in selecting an activation function? First the function has to give the desired behavior (arising from or as evidenced by sigmoidal shape). Second, the function must be differentiable. This is a requirement for backpropagation, which is the optimization technique used during training to 'fill in' the values of the hidden layers. For instance, the derivative of the hyperbolic tangent is (in terms of the output, which is how it is usually written) : def dsigmoid(y) :  return 1.0 - y**2 Beyond those two requriements, what makes one function between than another is how efficiently it trains the network--i.e., which one causes convergence (reaching the local minimum error) in the fewest epochs? #-------- Edit (see OP's comment below) ---------# I am not quite sure i understood--sometimes it's difficult to communicate details of a NN, without the code, so i should probably just say that it's fine subject to this proviso: What you want the NN to predict must be the same as the dependent variable used during training. So for instance, if you train your NN using two states (e.g., 0, 1) as the single dependent variable (which is obviously missing from your testing/production data) then that's what your NN will return when run in ""prediction mode"" (post training, or with a competent weight matrix).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2785382', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/279691/']}",jdg_171625

Question:
I want to give the option to specify some variables on the command-line for my psql-scripts with. psql -v myVar=myValue However I found no way to give those variables default values within the sql-script itself. The syntax: \set MyVar defaultValue overwrites the value myValue specified on the psql command-line unconditionally. Is there any way to check if a variable is set within psql?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Setting default values for variables is not supported in psql, but you can do it using a workaround. This psql command: \set myVar :myVar does nothing if the variable was already set via psql (this means, myVar is set again to his value), otherwise the variable is set literally to the string :myVar . Using this circumstance and the other psql command \gset , you can actually set a default value for myVar. Put this on the top of you sql script: \set myVar :myVar-- now myVar is set to the string ':myVar' if was not already set.-- Checking it using a CASE statement:SELECT CASE   WHEN :'myVar'= ':myVar'  THEN 'default_value'   ELSE :'myVar' END AS ""myVar""  \gset -- < \gset call at end of the query It seems to work only with text variables, but you can cast to numeric if you need numeric variables: SELECT CASE   WHEN :'myVar'= ':myVar'  THEN '10'   ELSE :'myVar' END::numeric AS ""myVar""  \gset How does \gset work: \gset allows you to set a variable from the result of a select query. The result variable is named like the column name, this is why you need the clause AS ""myVar"" at the end of the query (don't forget the double quotes if you want to use variables names with uppercase letters). For example the command: SELECT 'hello' AS var1 \gset sets the variable var1 to hello , the same as \set var1 hello See here for more infos: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/app-psql.html",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/32582600', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/291417/']}",jdg_139719

Question:
I've read some information about generics in .ΝΕΤ and noticed one interesting thing. For example, if I have a generic class: class Foo<T> {     public static int Counter; }Console.WriteLine(++Foo<int>.Counter); //1Console.WriteLine(++Foo<string>.Counter); //1 Two classes Foo<int> and Foo<string> are different at runtime. But what about case when non-generic class having generic method? class Foo {    public void Bar<T>()    {    }} It's obvious that there's only one Foo class. But what about method Bar ? All the generic classes and methods are closed at runtime with parameters they used with. Does it mean that class Foo has many implementations of Bar and where the information about this method stored in memory?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As opposed to C++ templates , .NET generics are evaluated in runtime, not at compile-time. Semantically, if you instantiate the generic class with different type parameters, those will behave as if it were two different classes, but under the hood, there is only one class in the compiled IL (intermediate language) code. Generic types The difference between different instantiatons of the same generic type becomes apparent when you use Reflection : typeof(YourClass<int>) will not be the same as typeof(YourClass<string>) . These are called constructed generic types . There also exists a typeof(YourClass<>) which represents the generic type definition . Here are some further tips on dealing with generics via Reflection. When you instantiate a constructed generic class , the runtime generates a specialized class on the fly. There are subtle differences between how it works with value and reference types. The compiler will only generate a single generic type into the assembly. The runtime creates a separate version of your generic class for each value type you use it with. The runtime allocates a separate set of static fields for each type parameter of the generic class. Because reference types have the same size, the runtime can reuse the specialized version it generated the first time you used it with a reference type. Generic methods For generic methods , the principles are the same. The compiler only generates one generic method, which is the generic method definition . In runtime, each different specialization of the method is treated as a different method of the same class.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/41461595', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/6210851/']}",jdg_257836

Question:
In the Advantages of Exceptions section of the Java™ tutorials: A method can duck any exceptions thrown within it, thereby allowing a method farther up the call stack to catch it. [...] ...ducking an exception requires some effort on the part of the middleman methods. Any checked exceptions that can be thrown within a method must be specified in its throws clause.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","To ""duck an exception"" means ""not handle the exception"". This actually explains the name: to duck means to ""To evade; dodge"". The method ducking the exception simply doesn't handle it (because, for example, it is not its purpose) and let the exception be thrown to the calling method. For example, consider a method whose purpose is to count the number of lines in a file. This would be a simple implementation (Java 8): private static long numberOfLines(Path path) throws IOException {    try (BufferedReader br = Files.newBufferedReader(path)) {        return br.lines().count();    }} Note that this method doesn't handle the IOException that is thrown by Files.newBufferedReader(path) , because that's not the method goal. It ducks and let the caller handle it appropriately.

","Unless you have a very good reason not to, please firewall all non-public ports on your Mac Minis immediately and only expose what you need to! I did a quick check and all of your services currently appear to be completely open to the internet (SSH, SMTP, Tomcat, VNC, MySQL and apple-xsrvr-admin (TCP625) certainly are), which is a very bad idea. The large amount of inbound traffic you're seeing may quite possibly be hackers/bots trying to brute-force logins and passwords for your services – I see this on servers a lot, particularly against SSH (as it's often public-facing) and directly against popular web software, such as WordPress's /wp-login.php page. From your netstat I can see that IPs from Israel and China were trying to access TCP625 (apple-xsrvr-admin, used for DirectoryService, Open Directory Assistant & Workgroup Manager), which isn't a good sign. I hope all of your usernames and passwords are strong, because – not trying to sound alarmist here, but – 7GB's worth of brute-forcing may have let some bad people get to things they shouldn't have access to, regardless of the security/patch state of any software. Check with your hosting provider/colo that you have some sort of remote serial console and/or VNC access should you accidentally block yourself from accessing your servers, then add the absolute minimum required for you to remote admin the servers yourself to the rulesets and turn the firewalls on, which I'm assuming they're not already. By default, OS X Server's firewall blocks all incoming ports except those used to configure the server remotely (TCP22, TCP311, TCP626, TCP625, ICMP standard ping (in & out), UDP53 DNS name resolution) so you should be OK to turn it straight on, though you want to lock these down more once you've done so. Create Address Groups that are specific to your office IP (or your ISP's IP netblock(s) if your office doesn't have a static IP address) and use these to open admin access (e.g. SSH, OpenDirectory, VNC) to these only. Create another Group with single IP access for 122.99.117.18 and 122.99.117.19 (or 122.99.117.18/31 mask) to talk to each other and allow this for the MySQL replication. Open the SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS ports to the world, assuming they're public-facing. Lock everything down tight, granting permission only to the IPs that need access to each port. Consider doing this for outbound traffic, too. You want to plan this in advance and make sure you get it all right, but do it soon rather than leaving the server an open sitting duck. Review your servers' logs and look for suspicious activity. In particular look for any successful logins to services from odd locations or at odd times. Establish some procedures to do this regularly. I'm not sure which version of OS X Server you have, but guessing at 10.6 or 10.7, this Peachpit document may help get you started on the firewalling front. As may this Apple support PDF on Networking Services (see chapter 4 for firewalling). For more advanced firewall configuration, try Waterroof or Icefloor, which provide a simple GUI rather than having to mess with pf on the commandline. (Edit to address the ipfilter rules pasted from each server) OK, let's start with venus1 (122.99.117.18). The obvious problem here is that there's no catch-all deny ip from any to any , so we need to fix that immediately. From the commandline, you can issue: sudo ipfw add 65534 deny log logamount 1000 ip from any to any Or do it from the Server Admin's Settings tab, under the Advanced sub-tab if you're not too comfortable with manipulating ipfw rules from the commandline (which should make you nervous as it can end badly if you slip up). There should be a list of Advanced Rules somewhat similar to the following image. Assuming that rule is there already at the bottom, tick it to enable it: Remember that the ipfw rules flow down the priority list, so a priority 1 rule takes precedence over everything else. So adding a 'deny everything' rule down at 65534 is last on the list, meaning it'll only deny a connection if everything above it doesn't allow something first. OK, with that out of the way, let's deal with some Address Groups. You've defined an Address Group that's 122.99.117.16/29, so 122.99.177.16-22 (where one IP's the gateway), which is your Mac Minis and other co-lo IP addresses. You probably want to define another Address Group for your office location, which I'm guessing at a static IP of 59.167.152.67 (or if your work gets a dynamic IP then the whole netblock of Internode is 59.167.0.0/16). Do this for both venus1 & venus2 and add more for any other offices you have. Once you've definied your office Groups then give each of these permission to access TCP22, TCP311, TCP626, TCP625, TCP3283 and TCP5900, so you can always admin your Minis even when you disable world-access to these ports. Using the GUI, go to the Services sub-tab of the Server Admin's Settings. Change the ""Editing Services for:"" to your office Address Group(s), then tick the relevant boxes for the above ports. Now let's address some more problematic venus1 rules. For instance: 12321    1570      78548 allow tcp from any to any dst-port 3306 Rule 12321 allows everything to connect to MySQL. Disable this rule for the ""any"" Address Group (using the Services sub-tab again) and while you're there, any other services that the world doesn't need access to. You probably want to keep TCP25 (smtp mail), TCP/UDP53 (dns), TCP80 (HTTP), TCP443 (HTTPS) world-accessible, but do you need world-access to TCP8080 (tomcat's server status)? Anything else? Lock it all down and only grant access to your office Address Group(s) and co-lo where appropriate (e.g. the MySQL replication). Remember to test everything! Learn to use nmap to scan your server ports so you can see what's open and closed. Scan from different locations (e.g. your office, ssh'ed into your other server, at home through another ISP, etc.) to make sure the rules are working as they should. Be careful not to lock yourself out, but do lock everything down as tight as you can. Re-read the Peachpit doc and Apple support PDF linked above and really learn the material, it'll stand you in good stead. Oh, and keep a regular eye on your logs! OK, hopefully that should see you right, or at least put you on a better path.

Question:
I have a control with several QSpinBox objects inside a QScrollArea.  All works fine when scrolling in the scroll area unless the mouse happens to be over one of the QSpinBoxes.  Then the QSpinBox steals focus and the wheel events manipulate the spin box value rather than scrolling the scroll area. I don't want to completely disable using the mouse wheel to manipulate the QSpinBox, but I only want it to happen if the user explicitly clicks or tabs into the QSpinBox.  Is there a way to prevent the QSpinBox from stealing the focus from the QScrollArea? As said in a comment to an answer below, setting Qt::StrongFocus does prevent the focus rect from appearing on the control, however it still steals the mouse wheel and adjusts the value in the spin box and stops the QScrollArea from scrolling.  Same with Qt::ClickFocus.

","Try removing Qt::WheelFocus from the spinbox' QWidget::focusPolicy : spin->setFocusPolicy( Qt::StrongFocus ); In addition, you need to prevent the wheel event from reaching the spinboxes.

Question:
Geiger and Marsden's experiment led Rutherford to believe that the positive charge and most of the mass of the atom was concentrated in a small region. I understand what led him to conclude the way the positive charge is positioned in the atom. But how did he conclude that most of the mass was in a small region (the nucleus)? How did the distribution of the mass matter after all? Given that the electric force is greater than the gravitational force by many magnitudes, the force between the positice charge and the electrons was predominantly electric. So how did Rutherford conclude that most of the mass is in the nucleus?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Wikipedia explains this rather well but I'll pick out the relevant stuff for you. Before the Geiger–Marsden experiment, the general idea was that atoms were built of some permeable positive substrate in which some negative particles were floating around; the so called plum-pudding model. If we shoot $\alpha$ particles on this setup they should all pass through the atoms since the positive substrate is thought to be permeable! (left side of the figure) But when people did the experiment they saw that most particles went through while some scattered $180^\circ$ backwards, some even bent a small angle! (right side of the figure) The plum-pudding model had no problem with the particles that went through undisturbed but what about the ones that were backscattered? People theorized that there must be some solid core in the atom against which the $\alpha$ particles could scatter. The core couldn't be too big since only a small fraction of the $\alpha$ particles backscattered.

Question:
I have always wondered whether public , protected , and private has security implications post compilation. Hypothetically: class Foo {public:    int m_Foo; // Completely vulnerable and dangerous    protected:    int m_Bar; // Possible attack vector from subclasses    private:    int m_FooBar; // Totally secure}; public members [by terminology alone] suggest that they are more vulnerable than private members, but I can not imagine how this could be taken advantage of post compilation in something like a proprietary program. Questions: Pre-Compilation, are members unneccessarily left in public , a security concern? Why or why not? Post-Compilation, are members unneccessarily left in public , a security concern? Why or why not? Are there any historical or hypothetical examples of attacks which used public designated members as an attack vector?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Access modifiers like public/private/protected are not intended as a security boundary. And since C++ is not a memory-safe language, this cannot be a security boundary . The laziest “attack” to access private members would be to reinterpret-cast the value to a struct with equivalent layout: struct PublicFoo {    int m_Foo;    int m_Bar;    int m_FooBar;};PublicFoo* attack(Foo* supposedly_secure) {  return reinterpret_cast<PublicFoo*>(supposedly_secure);} In some cases, I have manually calculated offsets in order to access fields for objects that were created by a different library, e.g. to pick out the m_Bar field: int attack_bar(Foo const* supposedly_secure) {  const auto start_of_the_object = reinterpret_cast<char*>(supposedly_secure);  const auto offset = sizeof(int);  // skip over m_Foo field  const auto location = start_of_the_object + offset;  return *reinterpret_cast<int*>(location);} So what are access modifiers for? They just help you to manage the data flows in your code. While you can circumvent access modifiers, you typically don't try to sabotage yourself. So if the field m_Foo must guarantee certain invariants, you want all modifications to that value to go through a method of your class. If you declare it private, then attempts to directly access this field will generate a helpful compiler error. This encapsulation helps you build more robust systems, which is especially helpful for larger projects or libraries. In other languages like Java, access modifiers can sometimes serve as a security boundary. But that only works because Java is a memory-safe language with an explicit security model, so tricks like reinterpret-casting do not work (and reflection can be prevented). But in general, you should not trust language constructs to guarantee security. You would want real sandboxing technology for security boundaries, e.g. Linux Containers.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/433503', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/136084/']}",jdg_122591

Question:
Consider $\mathbb{R}^n$ and its usual Euclidean norm given by the distance $d(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}$. Let $B(y,1) = \{ x\in \mathbb{R}^n : d(x,y) \leq 1 \}$ be the closed 1-ball around $y$ and  $B(0,2) = \{x\in \mathbb{R}^n:  d(x,0) \leq 2 \}$ be the 2-ball centered at the origin. How many 1-balls do you need to cover (contain) the 2-ball?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","There's a lower bound of $2^n$ that comes immediately from volume considerations.  For fixed $n$ I'm not sure when the upper bound is known exactly (this seems uncomfortably close to the Kepler conjecture, which was hard even in $3$ dimensions), but there's asymptotic results for covering space (or spheres of growing radii) by spheres going back to Rogers (""A Note on Coverings"", 1957...see also this paper of Ilya Dumer ) that might be able to get you something like $3^n n \log n$.  I'm not familiar enough with this area to say if there's more specific results pertaining to your problem. A quick (not at all optimal, and not my own, though I don't know a source to give for it) argument can get you a bound of $5^n$.  Consider the following process:  Place balls of radius $1/2$ centered at $x_1, x_2, \dots$ in the larger sphere, subject only to the constraint that no two of these balls intersect (these balls can lie partially outside the sphere, but they must be centered inside the sphere).  Continue placing these balls in an arbitrary fashion until no more such balls can be placed. At this point all the balls you have placed are disjoint and lie in a sphere of radius $5/2$ (the extra $1/2$ coming from balls which are centered near the edge of the original sphere).  Therefore there are at most $5^n$ balls placed.  Furthermore, each point in the sphere is within $1$ of one of your ball's centers, since otherwise you could fit another ball of radius $1/2$ in.  So replacing your radius $1/2$ balls with radius $1$ balls with the same center gives you a covering.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/105699', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/8501/']}",jdg_74111

Question:
I thought that the meaning of$$\frac{\partial f(x, y, z)}{\partial x}$$is differentiation on $x$ with fixed $y$ and $z$. So $(x, y, z)$ in the numerator is just saying which variables are fixed. If I need to indicate where the derivative is evaluated, I write it in the right of a vertical bar as a subscript. But today my teacher used $(x, y, z)$ in the numerator to denote where the derivative is evaluated. So, for example,$$\frac{\partial f(0, 0, 0)}{\partial x}$$means$$\frac{\partial f(x, y, z)}{\partial x} \bigg\rvert_{x=0,y=0,z=0}$$Is that a standard convention? If so, what is the meaning ofthis?$$\frac{\partial f(x, y, g(x, y))}{\partial x}$$I have two candidates. One is a partial derivative of the composition of $f$ and $g$ where $g$ has some fixed value, and the other is the partial derivative of $f$ on $x$ evaluated at $(x, y, g(x, y))$. I think the two are not the same.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Congratulations, you have met one of the worst ambiguities in mathematical notation! Assume you have a function of two variables, $f \colon A \times B \to \mathbb{R}$, where $A$ and $B$ are subsets of $\mathbb{R}$. The notation $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x_0,y_0)$$ is commonly used to denote the value of the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to the first variable, evaluated at $(x_0,y_0)$. This is the cleanest use of the notation for partial derivatives. Anyway, it sometimes happens to use some lazy piece of notation such as $$\frac{\partial f(x,g(x,y))}{\partial x}$$ to denote the partial derivative of the map $(x,y) \mapsto f(x,g(x,y))$. This is imcompatible (in general) with the interpretation of the same formula as The derivative of $f$ with respect to the first variable, evaluated at the point $(x,g(x,y))$. This is bad, but it seems we have to live with it. Why? Just spend a couple of minutes and think about the second interpretation. To be rigorous, we should have written$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( f \circ \left( (x,y) \mapsto (x,g(x,y)) \right) \right) (x,y),$$which is a true nightmare.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2200982', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/428852/']}",jdg_298551

Question:
I have a small script that's written in Scala which is intended to load a MongoDB instance up with 100,000,000 sample records. The idea is to get the DB all loaded, and then do some performance testing (and tune/re-load if necessary). The problem is that the load-time per 100,000 records increases pretty linearly. At the beginning of my load process it took only 4 seconds to load those records. Now, at nearly 6,000,000 records, it's taking between 300 and 400 seconds to load the same amount (100,000)! That's two orders of magnitude slower! Queries are still snappy, but at this rate, I'll never be able to load the amount of data that I'd like. Will this work faster if I write a file out with all of my records (all 100,000,000!), and then use mongoimport to import the whole thing? Or are my expectations too high and I'm using the DB beyond what it's supposed to handle? Any thoughts? Thanks!

Does this suggest something wrong in my development environment configuration? Also, I checked Proguard's Troubleshooting section for Can't find referenced class : It refers to forgetting or ignoring to specify a library via -libraryjars (which I admit), but I never specified any library and it always worked before! What changed? My proguard.cfg file BTW starts with: -optimizationpasses 5-dontusemixedcaseclassnames-dontskipnonpubliclibraryclasses-dontpreverify-verbose-optimizations !code/simplification/arithmetic,!field/*,!class/merging/* Any idea what's going on? Why did Proguard start giving me such hard time? (I coasted very smoothly with it for over a year now) Is there something fundamental I am missing in my system configuration?

What a nightmare. UPDATE 2: -dontwarn com.bta.** turned out to be way too inclusive. I changed it to: -dontwarn com.bta.myapp.MyAppActivity.R** And now everything runs well without incident. What a nightmare. After wasting way too much time on debugging the very tools that are supposed to save me time, I discovered the source of the problem. It's a bug in the Android SDK tools . It is documented as have been solved in r17, but I am using the latest of today (June 18 2012) and it hasn't been solved! (see comment 24). Comment 25 also describes the workaround that allows me now to proceed with my actual development. Bugs are fact of life in complex systems.

Question:
I was wondering if passing module objects to a class or object which requires it rather than using import might not be a bad idea, as it avoids hard dependencies on those modules. I was wondering if someone more aware of the Python Zen than I might be able to explain why this is a terrible/not terrible idea?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","What you're talking about is called dependency injection and is considered a good practice for making your code testable. I don't think there's anything about Python that would make it unPythonic or a bad practice. There are other ways you could do it in Python, for example by importing different modules depending on some kind of flag you pass in: class Foo(object):    def __init__(self, testing=False):        if testing:            import module_test as module        else:            import module        self.module = module But passing a reference to the module you wish to use is more flexible, separates concerns better, and is no less Pythonic than passing a reference to a class or instance (or string or integer) you wish to use. For the ordinary (non-test) use case, you can use a default argument value: class Foo(object):    def __init__(self, module=None):        if not module:            import module        self.module = module",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/9689355', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/460846/']}",jdg_131157

Question:
So i currently have: App.html <div>  <input on:input=""debounce(handleInput, 300)""></div><script>  import { debounce } from 'lodash'  export default {    data () {      name: ''    },    methods: {      debounce,      async handleInput (event) {        this.set({ name: await apiCall(event.target.value).response.name })      }    }  }</script> And get the error Uncaught TypeError: Expected a function at App.debounce . This comes from Lodash so it doesn't seem like the method from Svelte is being passed through. Extra extra edit Extra context for how i'm currently achieving it: oncreate () {  const debounceFnc = this.handleInput.bind(this)  this.refs.search.addEventListener('input', debounce(debounceFnc, 300))}

Now provide the response and nothing else.

","The Python parser interprets that as one string. This is well documented in the Lexical Analysis documentation : String literal concatenation Multiple adjacent string literals (delimited by whitespace), possibly using different quoting conventions, are allowed, and their meaning is the same as their concatenation. Thus, ""hello"" 'world' is equivalent to ""helloworld"" . The compiled Python code sees just the one string object; you can see this by asking Python to produce an AST of such strings: >>> import ast>>> ast.dump(ast.parse(""'hello' 'world'"", mode='eval').body)""Str(s='helloworld')"" In fact, it is the very act of building the AST that triggers the concatenation, as the parse tree is traversed, see the parsestrplus() function in the AST C source. The feature is specifically aimed at reducing the need for backslashes; use it to break up a string across physical lines when still within a logical line : print('Hello world!', 'This string is spans just one '      'logical line but is broken across multiple physical '      'source lines.') Multiple physical lines can implicitly be joined into one physical line by using parentheses, square brackets or curly braces. This string concatenation feature was copied from C, but Guido van Rossum is on record regretting adding it to Python .

Question:
I need to authorize a Controller in my ASP.NET MVC application to users which have two roles.I am using Authorize attribute like this: [Authorize(Roles = ""Producer, Editor"")] But this allows Producers and Editors to the controller. I want only to allow users having both roles, not just one of them. How could i achive this?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As the question states, when multiple roles are given in a single Authorize() call they are applied such that if the user belongs to any of the roles listed they will be granted access; like a logical OR operator. Alternatively, to achieve the effect of a logical AND operator you can apply the Authorize attribute multiple times . Eg.. [Authorize(Roles = ""Producer"")][Authorize(Roles = ""Editor"")]public ActionResult Details(int id) {    // Only available to users who are Producers AND Editors} For the example above, the action body is accessible only to users who belong to the Producer and the Editor roles. Rudi points out in the comments this lets you create some reasonably complex access rules without needing to implement a custom AuthorizeAttribute . For example, in the code below users can execute the action if they are both: a) in the Enabled role and b) in either the Editor or Admin roles. [Authorize(Roles = ""Enabled"")][Authorize(Roles = ""Editor,Admin"")]public ActionResult Details(int id) {    // Only available to users who are Enabled AND either an Admin OR an Editor} I'm not sure which version brought this in but it works in at least MVC 4 and 5.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/24738624', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1569279/']}",jdg_283527

","The Spacy documentation for vector similarity explains the basic idea of it: Each word has a vector representation, learned by contextual embeddings ( Word2Vec ), which are trained on the corpora, as explained in the documentation. Now, the word embedding of a full sentence is simply the average over all different words. If you now have a lot of words that semantically lie in the same region (as for example filler words like ""he"", ""was"", ""this"", ...), and the additional vocabulary ""cancels out"", then you might end up with a similarity as seen in your case. The question is rightfully what you can do about it: From my perspective, you could come up with a more complex similarity measure. As the search_doc and main_doc have additional information, like the original sentence, you could modify the vectors by a length difference penalty, or alternatively try to compare shorter pieces of the sentence, and compute pairwise similarities (then again, the question would be which parts to compare).

Question:
I have a table view with the potential for each cell to have its own height, thus isn't suitable to use rowHeight . Instead, right now I'm using let indexSet = NSIndexSet(index: 10) , and self.tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 75 . This means that it calls the sizeThatFits function on the cell, to determine its' height. This all works well. The problem is then when you reload a cell that's onscreen. Scrolling down to show cell 10, for example, then reloading cell 10, works fine. But when you begin to scroll back up, past the cells you've already seen, it reverts to the estimatedRowHeight for each cell, completely disregarding sizeThatFits , and so jumps around as you scroll. It'd be impossible for me to give an accurate or 'good enough' estimatedRowHeight so that this jumping wouldn't be noticeable, as my cells will be able to display either a line of text, or a full image - a big difference in size. I've shown this effect here: https://vid.me/edgW I've made many different attempts at this, using a mixture of heightForRowAtIndexPath, estimatedHeightForRowAtIndexPath.. etc.. I've tried various pieces of advice on StackOverflow. Nothing seems to work. I've attached a very simple sample project, where you can try it for yourself: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8f1rvkx9k23q6c1/tableviewtest.zip?dl=0 Run the project. Scroll until cell 10 is in view. Wait up to 5 seconds for the cell to reload (it becomes purple). Scroll up. Worth noting - this does not happen if the cell is not in view when it's reloaded. If it's either above or below the current scroll point, everything works as expected.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","This behavior appears to be a bug, if for no other reason than it's no longer reproducible on iOS 9. I'm sure that's not much consolation. The issue primarily derives from having an inaccurate estimate, like @NickCatib said. The best you can do on iOS 8 is to improve the estimation. A technique many have recommended is to cache heights in willDisplayCell and use them on subsequent calls to estimatedRowHeightAtIndexPath . You might be able to mitigate the behavior by not doing anything to get UITableView to discard its caches, like by modifying the content in a cell directly using cellForRowAtIndexPath rather than using reloading if it's onscreen. However, that won't help if you actually need to change the height of the cell. I'm afraid to say the bug can't be easily be fixed within a table view, as you don't have control over the layout. The bug can be more easily worked around in a subclass UICollectionViewFlowLayout by changing the contentOffsetAdjustment during invalidation, although that might not be terribly easy.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/32440874', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2876236/']}",jdg_350334

How can javascript determine the encoding of a string value in an html text box? Can I force the browser to only use UTF-8 encoding? How can I encode arbitrary encodings to UTF-8 I assume there is a JavaScript library for this? ** Edit ** Removed some questions unnecessary to my goals.

","How does a browser determine which encodings to use when a user is typing into a text box? It uses the encoding the page was decoded as by default. According to the spec , you should be able to override this with the accept-charset attribute of the <form> element, but IE is buggy, so you shouldn't rely on this (I've seen several different sources describe several different bugs, and I don't have all the relevant versions of IE in front of me to test, so I'll leave it at that). How can javascript determine the encoding of a string value in an html text box? All strings in JavaScript are encoded in UTF-16. The browser will map everything into UTF-16 for JavaScript, and from UTF-16 into whatever the page is encoded in. UTF-16 is an encoding that grew out of UCS-2. Originally, it was thought that 65,536 code points would be enough for all of Unicode, and so a 16 bit character encoding would be sufficient. It turned out that the is not the case, and so the character set was expanded to 1,114,112 code points. In order to maintain backwards compatibility, a few unused ranges of the 16 bit character set were set aside for surrogate pairs, in which two 16 bit code units were used to encode a single character. Read up on UTF-16 and UCS-2 on Wikipedia for details. The upshot is that when you have a string str in JavaScript, str.length does not give you the number of characters, it gives you the number of code units, where two code units may be used to encode a single character, if that character is not within the Basic Multilingual Plane. For instance, ""abc"".length gives you 3, but """".length gives you 6; and """".substring(0,1) gives what looks like an empty string, since a half of a surrogate pair cannot be displayed, but the string still contains that invalid character (I will not guarantee this works cross browser; I believe it is acceptable to drop broken characters). To get a valid character, you must use """".substring(0,2) . Can I force the browser to only use UTF-8 encoding? The best way to do this is to deliver your page in UTF-8. Ensure that your web server is sending the appropriate Content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 headers. You may also want to embed a <meta charset=""UTF-8""> element in your <head> element, for cases in which the Content-Type does not get set properly (such as if your page is loaded off of the local disk). How can I encode arbitrary encodings to UTF-8 I assume there is a JavaScript library for this? There isn't much need in JavaScript to encode text in particular encodings. If you are simply writing to the DOM, or reading or filling in form controls, you should just use JavaScript strings which are treated as sequences of UTF-16 code units. XMLHTTPRequest , when used to send(data) via POST, will use UTF-8 (if you pass it a document with a different encoding declared in the <?xml ...> declaration, it may or may not convert that to UTF-8, so for compatibility you generally shouldn't use anything other than UTF-8).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/1993833', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/74359/']}",jdg_282460

Question:
I cannot set the return type of getState() to RootState . I'm using typescript and VSCode. I have to set the type to any , which stops IntelliSense on that object. Below is the code that has the problem: export const unsubscribeMeta = createAsyncThunk(  'meta/unsubscribe',  async (_, { getState }) => {    const { meta } = getState() as any;    const res = await client.post<apiUnsubscribeResponse>(      `/meta/unsubscribe/${meta.subscriptionId}`    );    return res.data.data;  }); If I try to use RootState instead of any , many errors are flagged in the module by VSCode. I believe it is due to a circular dependency with the store and this slice. I am using RootState in many places further down in the module for selectors, with no problem. Is there a way around this?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You don't really need to know about the shape of the entire state.  You just need to know about the presence of the values which you are trying to access. If you can access the whole state.meta type: const { meta } = getState() as { meta: MetaState }; If not: const { meta } = getState() as { meta: { subscriptionId: string } }; I recommend this sort of approach for avoiding the circular dependency because the root state will always depend on the slices, so the slices should not depend on the root.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/64793504', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/-1/']}",jdg_142445

Question:
I'm trying to prove the following identity (of which I numerically verified the truth) : $$\text{For every $n\in\mathbb{N}^*$ and $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\setminus\lbrace-2k\text{ }|\text{ }k\in\mathbb{N}\rbrace$,}$$ $$\text{$\prod\limits_{k=1}^{n}$}\left[1-\frac{1}{2k+\alpha}\right]=\frac{\alpha}{4^{n}}{2n \choose n}\text{$\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n}$}\frac{{n \choose k}^2}{{2n \choose 2k}}\frac{1}{2k+\alpha}$$ I've tried induction, unsuccessfully. Tbh, I don't really have any other ideas for tackling it. Products such as this are not that easy to work with. Any ideas or suggestion ?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","For the identity $$\bbox[5px,border:2px solid #00A000]{\prod_{k=1}^n \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{2k+\alpha} \right]= \frac{\alpha}{4^n} {2n\choose n}\sum_{k=0}^n {n\choose k}^2 {2n\choose 2k}^{-1} \frac{1}{2k+\alpha}}$$ we work with $n\ge 2$ and we first simplify the RHS $$\frac{\alpha}{4^n} \frac{(2n)!}{n!\times n!}\sum_{k=0}^n \frac{n!^2}{k!^2 (n-k)!^2} \frac{(2k)!

Question:
In Swift 4, since now private is visible in extensions also in the same source code file, how is it different from the fileprivate access modifier? Background: In Swift 3, private variables in a class are not visible in its extensions in the same file. For that, fileprivate had to be used.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","File Private File-private access restricts the use of an entity to its own defining source file. Use file-private access to hide the implementation details of a specific piece of functionality when those details are used within an entire file.

Question:
Let $a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots$ be reals. Prove that if $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n^{2}$ converges, then so does $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {a_n}{n}$ . For this I have shown the case for when $ a_n^{2} \le\frac {|a_n|}{n}$ $\Rightarrow$ $ |a_n|\le\frac {1}{n}$ $\Rightarrow$ $\frac {|a_n|}{n} \le \frac{1}{n^{2}}$ and we know that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {1}{n^{2}}$ converges and hence $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac {a_n}{n}$ converges by the comparison test.Now considering $ a_n^{2} \ge\frac {|a_n|}{n}$ $\Rightarrow$ $\frac {|a_n|}{n} \le a_n^{2}$ $\rightarrow$ combining the two cases for any n we have: $\frac {|a_n|}{n}\le\frac{1}{n^{2}}+a_n^{2}$ Hence using the comparion test again we know that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n^{2}$ converges and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {1}{n^{2}}$ converges hence the sum converges so we can conclude that $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {a_n}{n}$ is absoluetly convergent $\Rightarrow$ convergent. Not to sure if this is correct, any help would be much appreciated, many thanks.

Question:
You have a class X and you write some unit tests that verify behaviour X1.There's also class A which takes X as a dependency. When you write unit tests for A, you mock X. In other words, while unit testing A, you set (postulate) the behaviour of X's mock to be X1.Time goes by, people do use your system, needs change, X evolves: you modify X to show behaviour X2. Obviously, unit tests for X will fail and you will need to adapt them. But what with A? Unit tests for A will not fail when X's behaviour is modified (due to the mocking of X). How to detect that A's outcome will be different when run with the ""real"" (modified) X? I'm expecting answers along the line of: ""That's not the purpose of unit testing"", but what value does unit testing have then? Does it really only tell you that when all tests pass, you haven't introduced a breaking change?And when some class's behaviour changes (willingly or unwillingly), how can you detect (preferably in an automated way) all the consequences? Shouldn't we focus more on integration testing?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","When you write unit tests for A, you mock X Do you? I don't, unless I absolutely have to. I have to if: X is slow, or X has side effects If neither of these apply, then my unit tests of A will test X too. Doing anything else would be taking isolating tests to an illogical extreme. If you have parts of your code using mocks of other parts of your code, then I'd agree: what is the point of such unit tests? So don't do this. Let those tests use the real dependencies as they form far more valuable tests that way. And if some folk get upset with you calling these tests, ""unit tests"", then just call them ""automated tests"" and get on with writing good automated tests.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/368423', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com', 'https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/users/28264/']}",jdg_157983

Question:
Reading the introduction of English Wikipedia's article about the t-test, I was confused by this statement: It is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow anormal distribution To this point I was sure that the key assumption for using t-test is that the data itself needs to be distributed normally (at least approximately). But here it's stated that the test statistic should follow a normal distribution. What am I missing? I understand that Wikipedia is not the most reliable source of information, but nevertheless I want to somehow interpret and double-check what I've read. Any help would be appreciated!

","Quoting (the complete sentence) from Wikipedia It is most commonly applied when the test statistic would follow anormal distribution if the value of a scaling term in the teststatistic were known (typically, the scaling term is unknown andtherefore a nuisance parameter). This sentence is true. Indeed, as stated in Dave's answer, the $t$ -statistic follows Student's $t$ when the population variance is unknown. However, when the latter is known and you use it in place of the sample variance, the implied statistic is actually a $z$ statistic, i.e. it has distribution $N(0,1)$ . On the other hand, if the data do not come from the normal distribution and if the true distribution is not too wired, the $t$ -test is still useful; see this answer by Stephan Kolassa.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/600261', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/376312/']}",jdg_331697

Question:
As the RingBuffer up-front allocates objects of a given type, how can you use a single ring buffer to process messages of various different types? You can't create new object instances to insert into the ringBuffer and that would defeat the purpose of up-front allocation. So you could have 3 messages in an async messaging pattern: NewOrderRequest NewOrderCreated NewOrderRejected So my question is how are you meant to use the Disruptor pattern for real-world messageing systems? Thanks Links: http://code.google.com/p/disruptor-net/wiki/CodeExamples http://code.google.com/p/disruptor-net http://code.google.com/p/disruptor

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","One approach (our most common pattern) is to store the message in its marshalled form, i.e. as a byte array.  For incoming requests e.g. Fix messages, binary message, are quickly pulled of the network and placed in the ring buffer.  The unmarshalling and dispatch of different types of messages are handled by EventProcessors (Consumers) on that ring buffer.  For outbound requests, the message is serialised into the preallocated byte array that forms the entry in the ring buffer. If you are using some fixed size byte array as the preallocated entry, some additional logic is required to handle overflow for larger messages.  I.e. pick a reasonable default size and if it is exceeded allocate a temporary array that is bigger.  Then discard it when the entry is reused or consumed (depending on your use case) reverting back to the original preallocated byte array. If you have different consumers for different message types you could quickly identify if your consumer is interested in the specific message either by knowing an offset into the byte array that carries the type information or by passing a discriminator value through on the entry. Also there is no rule against creating object instances and passing references (we do this in a couple of places too).  You do lose the benefits of object preallocation, however one of the design goals of the disruptor was to allow the user the choice of the most appropriate form of storage.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/6933347', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/839614/']}",jdg_92599

Question:
This question is asked before but I am still confused. I know that unsigned int a = -1; would be UINT_MAX . But it is not because all bits of -1 is set. C11 says if the new type is unsigned, the value is converted by repeatedly adding or  subtracting one more than the maximum value that can be represented in the new type  until the value is in the range of the new type So lets say UINT_MAX is 100 (I know it should be greater then 2^16-1 but lets ignore this for now) unsigned int a = -1; // will beunsigned int a = -1 + UINT_MAX + 1; // 100 = UINT_MAX Standard only says UINT_MAX >= 2^16-1 . But does it say anywhere it should be 2^n-1? Also is answer different in C++?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","In C, the maximum value for an unsigned integer must be in the form 1 : 2 N - 1. Thus all value bits of the value UINT_MAX will be set to 1. There may be padding bits, whose values are unspecified. 1 (Quoted from: ISO/IEC 9899:201x 6.2.6.2 Integer types 1) For unsigned integer types other than unsigned char, the bits of the object representation shall be divided into two groups: value bits and padding bits (there need not be any of the latter). If there are N value bits, each bit shall represent a different power of 2 between 1 and 2 N −1 , so that objects of that type shall be capable of representing values from 0 to 2 N −1 using a pure binary representation; this shall be known as the value representation.

","If you want, you can actually calculate what it converges to by appealing to complex numbers.  The sum is the imaginary part of $$\sum \frac{e^{nix}}{2^n} = \sum \left(\frac{e^{ix}}{2}\right)^n = \frac{2}{2-e^{ix}},$$so your sum converges to $\frac{2 \sin x}{5 - 4\cos x}$.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/6365', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/2399/']}",jdg_337599

Question:
Possible Duplicate: What is InnoDB and MyISAM in MySQL? in my project database some of table has engine type innoDB and some others Myisam.why it was set like this ?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The 2 major types of table storage engines for MySQL databases are InnoDB and MyISAM. To summarize the differences of features and performance, InnoDB is newer while MyISAM is older. InnoDB is more complex while MyISAM is simpler. InnoDB is more strict in data integrity while MyISAM is loose. InnoDB implements row-level lock for inserting and updating while MyISAM implements table-level lock. InnoDB has transactions while MyISAM does not. InnoDB has foreign keys and relationship contraints while MyISAM does not. InnoDB has better crash recovery while MyISAM is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes. MyISAM has full-text search index while InnoDB has not. In light of these differences, InnoDB and MyISAM have their unique advantages and disadvantages against each other. They each are more suitable in some scenarios than the other. Advantages of InnoDB InnoDB should be used where data integrity comes a priority because it inherently takes care of them by the help of relationship constraints and transactions. Faster in write-intensive (inserts, updates) tables because it utilizes row-level locking and only hold up changes to the same row that’s being inserted or updated. Disadvantages of InnoDB Because InnoDB has to take care of the different relationships between tables, database administrator and scheme creators have to take more time in designing the data models which are more complex than those of MyISAM. Consumes more system resources such as RAM. As a matter of fact, it is recommended by many that InnoDB engine be turned off if there’s no substantial need for it after installation of MySQL. No full-text indexing. Advantages of MyISAM Simpler to design and create, thus better for beginners. No worries about the foreign relationships between tables. Faster than InnoDB on the whole as a result of the simpler structure thus much less costs of server resources. Full-text indexing. Especially good for read-intensive (select) tables. Disadvantages of MyISAM No data integrity (e.g. relationship constraints) check, which then comes a responsibility and overhead of the database administrators and application developers. Doesn’t support transactions which is essential in critical data applications such as that of banking. Slower than InnoDB for tables that are frequently being inserted to or updated, because the entire table is locked for any insert or update. The comparison is pretty straightforward. InnoDB is more suitable for data critical situations that require frequent inserts and updates. MyISAM, on the other hand, performs better with applications that don’t quite depend on the data integrity and mostly just select and display the data.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It's in no way comparable like this. While you can get same data (in some cases) from boththeir intents are completely different: FQL is a query language, Graph is an API. Calling to FQL query if using new JS SDK is a Graph API call itself... You can (and probably should, if you worry about real comparison and not theoretical speculation) compare speed of calls returning same data but you should take into account some things: Graph API still sucks at data filtering conditions and aggregation of data FQL just can't provide you too many of functionality required in today's applications (like Real-Time updates ) Graph API have an ability batch calls, which may speed up things a lot, this also can be used to call fql.query and fql.multiquery (in a bit cumbersome way). Graph API rocks at data filtering with Field Expansion Consider following example from FQL documentation , subquery that fetches all user information for the active user and friends: SELECT uid, name, pic_square FROM user WHERE uid = me()OR uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me()) This simply not possible to achieve with a single Graph API call. (see Update) Once you define desired subset of data to get you can choose appropriate method of retrieval based on your requirements. BTW, FQL is much older than Graph, we had it aside to FBML (rip) and FBJS (rip) Update: Graph API providing way for Batch Requests and specifying dependencies between operations in the request. For example same sample as above can be achieved in a single call to Graph API POST https://graph.facebook.com/POST Data:batch=[  {    ""method"": ""GET"",    ""name"" : ""get-friends"",    ""relative_url"": ""me/friends?fields=id"",  },  {    ""method"": ""GET"",    ""relative_url"": ""?ids={result=get-friends:$.data.*.id}&fields=id,name,picture""  }] Update 2: As of 30 August 2012 Graph API is also support Field Expansion as additional (very powerful) mechanism of data retrieval (including nested data)",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/7641925', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/957913/']}",jdg_120563

Question:
I know I can install ntp in the guest, but my confused understanding of what I've Googled so far suggests this shouldn't be necessary. The Host is CentOS 6.3 and guest is Debian Wheezy, which seems to be using the kvm clock as a time source: # cat /sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksourcekvm-clock Is there something special I need to do to make the guest use the host clock?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The guest has no direct access to the host clock.  Instead, it uses kvm-clock which points to a memory region updated by the host, from the host's clock.  As such, the guest is using the host clock.  The issue is that this memory region isn't updated constantly, it's only updated when there's a VM 'event', and as such, guests can drift and then lurch back to the correct time. The general advice, as far as I can see, is ensure the VM is doing something on a regular basis, so that it re-reads the host clock on a regular basis.

Question:
Consider this code : a = {...} # a is an dict with arbitrary contentsb = a.copy() What role does mutability play in the keys and values of the dicts? How do I ensure changes to keys or values of one dict are not reflected in the other? How does this relate to the hashable constraint of the dict keys? Are there any differences in behaviour between Python 2.x and Python 3.x? How do I check if a type is mutable in Python?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","1) Keys must not be mutable, unless you have a user-defined class that is hashable but also mutable. That's all that's forced upon you. However, using a hashable, mutable object as a dict key might be a bad idea. 2) By not sharing values between the two dicts. It's OK to share the keys, because they must be immutable. Copying the dictionary, in the copy module sense, is definitely safe. Calling the dict constructor here works, too: b = dict(a) . You could also use immutable values. 3) All built-in immutable types are hashable. All built-in mutable types are not hashable. For an object to be hashable, it must have the same hash over its entire lifetime, even if it is mutated. 4) Not that I'm aware of; I'm describing 2.x. A type is mutable if it is not immutable. A type is immutable if it is a built-in immutable type: str , int , long , bool , float , tuple , and probably a couple others I'm forgetting. User-defined types are always mutable. An object is mutable if it is not immutable. An object is immutable if it consists, recursively, of only immutable-typed sub-objects. Thus, a tuple of lists is mutable; you cannot replace the elements of the tuple, but you can modify them through the list interface, changing the overall data.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/4374006', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/149482/']}",jdg_288405

Question:
I'm trying to generate a UI element that is dynamic based on how the user wishes to provide their input. I'm using the Shiny Dashboard for simplicity but I have encountered an issue with the sidebarMenu. Previously when I was placing static UI elements directly into the sidebarMenu, I had no issue, however when trying to place dynamic UI elements into the sidebarMenu I have problems. I'm using R 3.3.2 and Shiny 1.0.0 and Dashboard 0.5.3. The specific problem I have is that when the program first loads up, the dynamic UI elements do not load. There does not appear to be any holdup in the code, as all the features of the interface work fine even while the dynamic UI is unloaded. I am able to get the dynamic UI to load by selecting one of the tabs in the navbar, or by hovering over something that I have implemented a tooltip on.

Question:
I want to increase the number of minor ticks in a plot, but I don't want to label them. I searched through this site and also Mathematica documentation, but I didn't find any solution yet.

For an example: Plot[2*Sin[x], {x, 0, 10}, Frame -> True,  FrameTicks -> {True, True, False, False}, Axes -> True,  AxesOrigin -> {0, 0}] I want to get 10 minor tick marks in between 0 and 1 and so on (in between major tick marks on both axis).

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Here's another approach, very similar to swish's. The difference being that it should work on all sorts of plot ranges. The idea is to define a ticks function with min_ and max_ (idea from Ticks in documentation): ticks[min_, max_] :=   Table[If[FractionalPart[i] == 0., {i, i, .06, Red}, {i, """", .02,Blue}],   {i, Floor[min], Ceiling[max], 0.1}] Then the graph: Plot[2*Sin[x], {x, -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, Frame -> True,   FrameTicks -> {ticks, ticks, False, False}, Axes -> True] and we get: we note that we could use any condition within the Table in ticks (e.g. use Switch or Which to get mid-ticks, etc. Also, here is a version that let's the user specify ranges of noteworthy ticks directly: r1 = Range[-3, 3, 0.2];r2 = Range[-3, 3, 0.1];tickfreq = 0.05;ticks[min_, max_] :=  Table[With[{val = Round[Abs@FractionalPart[i], 0.01]},    Which[Chop[Min[Abs[r1 - val]]] == 0, {i, i, .06, Red},     Chop[Min[Abs[r2 - val]]] == 0, {i, """", .04, Green},     1 < 2, {i, """", .02, Blue}]], {i, Floor[min], Ceiling[max],    tickfreq}] where tickfreq specifies the frequency of the blue (base-) ticks, r1 the red ticks (with labels), r2 the green additional ticks. Using then the PlotRange you specify in the comments, we get: Plot[2*Sin[x], {x, -\[Pi], \[Pi]}, Frame -> True,  FrameTicks -> {ticks, ticks, False, False}, Axes -> True,  PlotRange -> {{-0.5, 3.5}, {-0.25, 0.3}}] Alternatively, one could also use different ticks version for the axes, but I am sure you get the idea.

Question:
I am a bit struggling with bash programming, because I don't seem to understand the syntax rules. For example: read confirmif [ ""$confirm"" == ""yes"" ]; then    echo ""Thank you for saying yes""else    echo ""Why did you say no?""fi In this code, you can use many forms to do the same thing: ""$confirm"" == ""yes""$confirm == ""yes""""$confirm"" == yes$confirm == yes So what is the rule? Besides that, it is very strict, so if you write the above if statement without the space between '[' and '""', you would get an error. So my questions: Can anybody give me an idea about the 'basic' rules of syntax in shell scripting? You can call it grammar if you want. There are three different shell programming scripts as far as I know. Which one of them is the easiest to learn for programmers of languages like C++, C#, and Java? Regards, Rafid

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The rules are simple but subtle. The examples you gave are not all equivalent, they have subtly different meanings. For a fairly good reference you can read Shell Command Language , which covers POSIX shells. Most shells, certainly including bash, zsh and ksh, are POSIX shells and will implement at least what is listed there. Some shells may conform to earlier versions of the specification or be similar but not conformant. The primary rule that you will need to remember if you are learning Unix shell scripting is this: Expressions are separated by spaces. Technically they are separated by whatever characters are listed in the variable $IFS, but this amounts to whitespace under normal circumstances. If you say [""$a""=""$b""] in bash the shell tries to read the entire string as a command, evaluating $a and $b in place. Supposing the value of $a was a literal a and the value of $b was a literal b , the shell would attempt to execute a command called [a=b] , which is a legal file name. The quotation marks were interpreted by the shell as special but the [ was not, because it is only special if written as a separate token. It was not separated by spaces. Almost everything you see and do in a shell is a command. The character [ isn't syntax, it's a command. Commands take arguments, separated by spaces. What those arguments mean is up to the command, not the shell. In C if ( a == b ) is handled all by the parser, except for the values of a and b. In bash if [ ""$a"" == ""$b"" ] is first parsed by the shell, which evaluates the variables $a and $b, and then the command [ is executed. Sometimes this is a shell builtin command, sometimes it is literally a separate executable (look for /bin/[ in your system). This means that a == b ] is not interpreted by bash at all but instead is a kind of domain-specific language that is interpreted by [ , which is also known as test . In fact you can write if test ""$a"" == ""$b"" instead. In this form test does not require the closing ] , but everything else is the same. To see what test will do with these arguments read help test or man test . The other rule to remember when learning Unix shell scripting is this: Variables are expanded first, commands are evaluated second. This means that if you have a space in a variable, such as foo=""a b"" then the shell will see the space after the variable is expanded: ls $foo by itself will complain that it cannot find the file a and it cannot find the file b . To get the behavior you probably expect from other languages you almost always will want to quote your variables: ls ""$foo"" , which instructs the shell that the expanded variable is to be treated as a single string and not re-tokenized. Shell scripting is filled with oddities but it is not irrational (at least not most of the time). Some historical warts do exist but there are really not very many rules to remember once you get the hand of the basics. Just do not expect it to operate like a conventional C-like language and you won't be too surprised.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/4396659', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/196697/']}",jdg_216717

What can i do to upgrade to a latest version ?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Do not manually upgrade Apache. Manual upgrading for security is unnecessary and probably harmful. How Debian releases software To see why this is, you must understand how Debian deals with packaging, versions, and security issues. Because Debian values stability over changes, the policy is to freeze the software versions in the packages of a stable release. This means that for a stable release very little changes, and once things work they should continue working for a long time. But, what if a serious bug or security issue is discovered after release of a Debian stable version? These are fixed, in the software version provided with Debian stable . So if Debian stable ships with Apache 2.4.10 , a security issue is found and fixed in 2.4.26 , Debian will take this security fix, and apply it to 2.4.10 , and distribute the fixed 2.4.10 to its users. This minimizes disruptions from version upgrades, but it makes version sniffing such as Tenable does meaningless. Serious bugs are collected and fixed in point releases (the .9 in Debian 8.9 ) every few months. Security fixes are fixed immediately and provided through an update channel. In general, as long as you run a supported Debian version, stick to stock Debian packages, and stay up to date on their security updates, you should be good. Your Tenable report To check if Debian stable is vulnerable for your issues, Tenable's ""2.4.x < 2.4.27 multiple issues"" is useless. We need to know exactly which security issues they are talking about. Luckily, every significant vulnerability is assigned a Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) identifier, so we can talk easily about specific vulnerabilities. For example, on this page for Tenable issue 101788 we can see that that issue is about vulnerabilities CVE-2017-9788 and CVE-2017-9789. We can search for these vulnerabilities on the Debian security tracker . If we do that, we can see that CVE-2017-9788 has the status ""fixed"" in or before version 2.4.10-10+deb8u11 . Likewise, CVE-2017-9789 is fixed . Tenable issue 10095 is about CVE-2017-3167 , CVE-2017-3169 , CVE-2017-7659 , CVE-2017-7668 , and CVE-2017-7679 , all fixed. So if you're on version 2.4.10-10+deb8u11 , you should be safe from all these vulnerabilities! You can check this with dpkg -l apache2 (ensure your terminal is wide enough to show the full version number). Staying up to date So, how do you ensure you're up to date with these security updates? First, you need to have the security repository in your /etc/apt/sources.list or /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* , something like this: deb http://security.debian.org/ jessie/updates main This is a normal part of any installation, you should not have to do anything special. Next, you must ensure that you install updated packages. This is your responsibility; it is not done automatically. A simple but tedious way is to log in regularly and run # apt-get update# apt-get upgrade Judging from the fact that you report your Debian version as 8.8 (we're at 8.9) and the ... and 48 not upgraded. from your post, you might want to do this soon. To be notified of security updates, I higly recommend subscribing to the Debian security announcements mailinglist . Another option is ensuring your server can send you emails, and installing a package like apticron , which emails you when packages on your system need updating. Basically, it regularly runs the apt-get update part, and pesters you to do the apt-get upgrade part. Finally, you could install something like unattended-upgrades , which not only checks for updates, but automatically installs the updates without human intervention. Upgrading the packages automatically without human supervision carries some risk, so you need to decide for yourself if that is a good solution for you. I use it and I'm happy with it, but caveat updator. Why upgrading yourself is harmful In my second sentence, I said upgrading to the latest Apache version is probably harmful . The reason for this is simple: if you follow Debian's version of Apache, and make a habit of installing the security updates, then you are in a good position, security-wise. Debians security team identifies and fixes security issues, and you can enjoy that work with minimal effort. If, however, you install Apache 2.4.27+, say by downloading it from the Apache website and compiling it yourself, then the work of keeping up with security issues is fully yours. You need to track security issues, and go through the work of downloading/compiling/etc every time a problem is found. It turns out this is a fair amount of work, and most people slack off. So they end up running their self-compiled version of Apache that becomes more and more vulnerable as issues are found. And so they end up a lot worse than if they simply had followed Debian's security updates. So yes, probably harmful. That's not to say there's no place for compiling software yourself (or selectively taking packages from Debian testing or unstable), but in general, I recommend against it. Duration of security updates Debian doesn't maintain its releases forever. As a general rule, a Debian release recieves full security support for one year after it has been obsoleted by a newer release. The release you're running, Debian 8 / jessie , is an obsoleted stable release ( oldstable in Debian terms). It will receive full security support until May 2018 , and long-term support until April 2020. I'm not entirely sure what the extent of this LTS support is. The current Debian stable release is Debian 9 / stretch . Consider upgrading to Debian 9 , which comes with newer versions of all software, and full security support for several years (likely until mid-2020). I recommend upgrading at a time that is convenient for you, but well before May 2018. Closing remarks Earlier, I wrote that Debian backports security fixes. This ended up being untenable for some software due to the high pace of development and high rate of security issues. These packages are the exception, and actually updated to a recent upstream version. Packages I know of this applies to are chromium (the browser), firefox , and nodejs . Finally, this entire way of dealing with security updates is not unique to Debian; many distributions work like this, especially the ones that favour stability over new software.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/404036', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com', 'https://unix.stackexchange.com/users/236919/']}",jdg_360616

Question:
I am trying to write the time on the same line instead of it stacking the outputs. I can not seem to get it to work though. Here is what I have: I thought the ""\r"" would make it reprint on the same line, but this doesn't work. And I also tried printf(""\r""); and that didn't work either. Can anyone help me figure out how to get this to work? void countdown(int time){    int h = (time / 3600);    int m = (time / 60) - (h * 60);    int s = time % 60;    std::stringstream ss;    ss << h << "":"" << m << "":"" << s;    std::string string = ss.str();    cout << ""\r"" << string << endl;}

","cout << ""\r"" << string << endl; endl moves the cursor to the next line.  Try replacing it with std::flush which just ensures output's sent towards the terminal.

Question:
Rorguitars claim to have the best MIDI* guitar system on the market. Their website says: Our guitars do not have MIDI pickups. There is NO pitch detection to send the MIDI signals. Our instruments use an electronic system that senses the frets you press on the fretboard and sends the corresponding notes. [Thanks to Steve G for pointing this out.] It's not possible to get polyphonic guitar to MIDI conversion based on electrical string/fret contact scanning alone (segmented frets pose wear problems, and it doesn't look like they use them in their product),so some additional sensing must be involved. Multipress keyboards are possible but they can use diodes to prevent crossfeed between rows and columns. This isn't possible on the point of contact between string and fret. Apparently developed at University of Limerick, Ireland, there is no further info on the web. Probably they don't want to disclose it. What techniques could be employed to determine the highest fret pressed on each string in such an instrument while handling the short circuits produced by multiple string presses on multiple frets? (Each string press contacts the fret above and below the point of pressure.) To illustrate: Frets and strings form a matrix which can be scanned. Single notes and notes apart more than two frets pose no problem, but ambiguity arises with close spaced chords, here a simple doublestop. Both the G and D string read frets 2,3 and 4, as the conducting path in blue crosses strings. Determining the shortest path (in green) provides the additional information required to discern chord shapes. Out of the possibilities Capacitance Resistance Reflectometry for string sensing, lets pick the last option - not least for the purposes of being specific. Also the first two might be influenced by hand contact. It is not necessary to detect exact lengths, being able to compare whether one fret is closer than the other is sufficient. So the question is whether it's feasible, given the required rise times, to implement this in a suitable form factor. Edit: I found an interesting patent from 1984 (US4630520) by Turtle Beach cofounder Carmine Bonanno. Wonder why it never took off. It's the combination approach I had in mind, only with resistance sensing, as suggested by Transistor. Frets and strings are scanned separately by multiplexers. As reliability issue he stressed the fret/string contact resistance, requiring low current, therefore high input impedance. I wonder however if an (initial) sufficiently high wetting current (snubber capacitor?) might help alleviate noisy junctions. MIDI (/ˈmɪdi/; short for Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is a technical standard that describes a protocol, digital interface and connectors and allows a wide variety of electronic musical instruments, computers and other related devices to connect and communicate with one another. MIDI carries event messages that specify notation, pitch and velocity, control signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato, audio panning, cues, and clock signals that set and synchronize tempo between multiple devices. Generating MIDI signals from non-keyboard instruments such as, in this case, a guitar poses some interesting electronic design challenges. While keyboard instruments are relatively straight-forward to digitise string and wind instruments have many more nuances that are difficult to detect and measure and, therefore, difficult to convert to MIDI.

","Well, you have one very serious problem shown in your images. You have specified the pulse period to be \$10\:\mu \textrm{s}\$, but the on-time to be \$500\:\mu \textrm{s}\$. That's not going to fly, no matter how you do the rest. But then you have another serious problem. I assume you want to see an RC time constant taking place. But you've wired up your \$3.3\:\textrm{V}\$ source directly across \$C_1\$. So, once again this isn't going to fly. It is only a minor problem that you probably don't have much information on your open-drain NMOS output's characteristics. Effectively, you can do reasonable work just knowing the approximate equivalent \$R_{on}\$. So, I'm going to read between all the lines and take a clue from your circuit about how you want to simulate the switching process. LTspice just happens to have a ""SW"" part you can probably use. It supports three modes: ON/OFF mode, ON/OFF with hysteresis mode, and a gradual ON, gradual OFF mode. Use the help and type in SW and select that and read the documentation on it. You should be able to achieve what you want in approximating an open-drain output with the SW part (which can be selected easily using F2 to get the dialog box with parts in it.) Since you were looking at an RC time constant of about \$100\:\mu \textrm{s}\$ Here's what an example circuit might look like: I've adjusted the period to exaggerate the curves a bit. There are about 5 tau's of time allowed for \$R_1\$ to charge \$C_1\$ back up, so it gets almost back to the top there. Also, note that I set \$R_{on}\$ on the switch to \$100\:\Omega\$. You can set it where you want. But this is one approach. (By playing with the \$V_h\$ parameter of the switch model, making it negative, you can even get a rise-time out of the switch. I've set it to 0, which just means ON/OFF behavior.)

The results I'm after are calculated by foo.py and are currently just printed to stdout with a python print statement. How can I get this to be included in the docker container logs so I can read it from within python? Or capture this output some other way from outside the container?

Question:
I have recenlty stumbled into Zend Lucene port of Lucene project. I have a little bit experience with SOLR so I would like to know what is the difference between two of them especially from performance and installation side. As much as I know SOLR requires Tomcat serverlet running in web hosting in order to work, what about Zend Lucene library? I am also a bit confused what means ""being implemented on the top of Lucene""?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Java Lucene, and all its ports to other languages, including Zend Lucene, are search libraries . This means that in order to use Zend Lucene, you have to wrap it in other (PHP) code, that will integrate the search with the rest of your application. The code generally needs to manage indexing, retrieval and usually some housekeeping of Lucene. You communicate with Zend Lucene using PHP function calls. Solr, OTOH, is a search server built on top of Lucene. This means that a Solr instance can run as a stand-alone server webapp inside a servlet container (That could be Tomcat, Jetty or one of several other such programs). It is much easier to set up a Solr server than a Lucene application. You can do a lot with Solr without writing a single line of Java - just by tweaking some XML configuration files. Setting up a Solr server may take as few as several minutes. The default way to communicate with Solr is using HTTP calls. So basically Zend Lucene installation requires having a PHP server and proper indexing and retrieval using a PHP library. Solr installation requires running a Java servlet container and deploying a war file into it. Regarding performance, Solr has many of Lucene caching and other parameters optimized. Also, I believe Zend Lucene is slower than Java Lucene, so my bet is that Solr would be faster, but this really depends on the specific application.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3037564', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/278984/']}",jdg_264126

","The difference between Union and Union all is that UNION ALL will not eliminate duplicate rows, instead it just pulls all rows from all tables fitting your query specifics and combines them into a table. A UNION statement effectively does a SELECT DISTINCT on the results set. If you select Distinct from Union All result set, Then the output will be equal to the Union result set. Edit: Performance on CPU cost: Let me explain with Example: I have two queries. one is Union another one is Union All SET STATISTICS TIME ONGO select distinct * from (select * from dbo.user_LogTimeunion allselect * from dbo.user_LogTime) X GOSET STATISTICS TIME OFFSET STATISTICS TIME ONGO select * from dbo.user_LogTimeunionselect * from dbo.user_LogTimeGOSET STATISTICS TIME OFF I did run the both in same query window in SMSS.Lets see the Execution Plan in SMSS: What happens is, The query with Union All and Distinct will take CPU cost more than Query with Union . Performance on Time: UNION ALL : (1172 row(s) affected)SQL Server Execution Times:   CPU time = 0 ms,  elapsed time = 39 ms. UNION : (1172 row(s) affected)SQL Server Execution Times:   CPU time = 10 ms,  elapsed time = 25 ms. So Union is much better than the Union All with Distinct in performance-wise",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/35627923', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1252228/']}",jdg_102116

How to show an indeterminate horizontal progress bar in android? The animation of the progress bar should start from 0 to 100 and then go back from 100 to 0 continuously. I am not looking for the wheel progress bar.

","I already knew that setIndeterminate will give an infinite horizontal progress bar. But it will be similar to the loading wheel, except that it will be horizontal. If you see my question I was looking for horizontal bar which starts from 0 and goes all the way to 100 (a gradual increase). If you want to achieve this in Android, you must use your progress bar as below: <ProgressBar    android:id=""@+id/progress_horizontal""    android:indeterminateOnly=""false""    android:indeterminateDrawable=""@drawable/progress_indeterminate_horizontal""    android:progressDrawable=""@drawable/progress_horizontal""    android:minHeight=""24dip""    android:maxHeight=""24dip""     android:layout_width=""fill_parent""    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""/> As I wanted to change the background of my progress bar, I changed the ProgressDrawable and IndeterminateDrawable. The original drawables are located under frameworks/base/core/res/res/drawable . Copy them to your project and change the color according to your needs. Create a thread which updates the progress count and does a Thread.Sleep .

And finally creating a root store in the following manner. Also I prefer to construct children stores within master's store constructor. Moreover, I found that sometimes my child store has to observe some data from parent store, so I pass this into child constructors class RootStore {  constructor() {    this.bankAccountStore = new bankAccountStore(this);    this.authStore = new authStore(this);  }} Providing to the App in following manner: <Provider rootStore={new RootStore()}>  <App /></Provider> And injecting to the component in like this: @inject('rootStore') @observerclass User extends React.Component{  constructor(props) {    super(props);    //Accessing the individual store with the help of root store    this.authStore = this.props.rootStore.authStore;  }} Question 1: Is it this the correct and most efficient way to inject the root store into the component every time even if it needs a part of the root store?

Approach 1: App.js // Root Store Declarationclass RootStore {    constructor() {      this.userStore = new UserStore(this);      this.authStore = new AuthStore(this);    }}    const rootStore = new RootStore()// Provide the store to the children<Provider     rootStore={rootStore}    userStore={rootStore.userStore}    authStore={rootStore.authStore}>  <App /></Provider> Component.js // Injecting into the component and using it as shown below@inject('authStore', 'userStore')@observerclass User extends React.Component {    // only this.props.userStore.userVariable} Approach 2: App.js class RootStore {    constructor() {      this.userStore = new UserStore(this);      this.authStore = new AuthStore(this);    }} const rootStore = new RootStore()<Provider rootStore={rootStore}>  <App /></Provider> Component.js // Injecting into the component and using it as shown below@inject(stores => ({    userStore: stores.userStore,    authStore: stores.authStore,    }))@observerclass User extends React.Component {    // no this.props.rootStore.userStore,userVariable here,     // only this.props.userStore.userVariable} Approach 1 and Approach 2 doesn't make any difference other than syntax difference. Okay! that is the injection part! Question 2: What's the best way to communicate between stores? (Try to avoid it) Now I know a good design keeps stores independent andless coupled. But somehow consider a scenario where I want thevariable in UserStore to change if a certain variable in AuthStore is changed. Use Computed .

Determine the maximum and the minimum possible values for $P(A \& B)$ and the conditions under which each of these values is attained. To solve, I considered the event with the lowest probability $A$ to be a subset of the other, so maximum value is attained under that circumstance giving a probability of $0.4$.But the book states that the minimum is $0.1$, if $P(A \cup B) = 1$. I don't understand why! Because I thought that the minimum value is get when the two events are disjoint... So the minimum value must be $0$...

Question:
I am creating a function which generates a privateKey for RSA. The underlying algorithm for generating a privateKey is the Extended Euclidean algorithm. According to Wikipedia, the output of this algorithm is a ""Bézout's identity"". I never heard of Bézout's identity before and wanted to know what it's importance is and what is it used for, but I can't find a clear answer. Googling ""What is the importance of Bézout's identity?"" yields no relevant results. The closest thing I could find was a discussion on Wikipedia:Talk The point is that Bézout's identity is an important result which is  used in many areas of mathematics. In particular it is one of the  starting tools (with modular arithmetic) of Diophantine equation  theory To someone who does not have an extensive mathematical background the above discussion is meaningless. Can someone describe the importance and use-cases for Bézout's identity in layman terms?

","Given integers $m,n$ (not both zero), Bezout's identity finds integers $x,y$ that satisfy: $$xm+ny=\gcd(m,n)$$ One important application is if we know $\gcd(m,n)=1$.  Then, we can take the above equation modulo $n$ to get $$xm\equiv 1\pmod{n}$$This is useful, because we have found the multiplicative inverse to $m$, modulo $n$ . We have a constructive (and fast) way to find $x,y$, using the extended Euclidean algorithm . One reason a multiplicative inverse is useful is: suppose we want to find some integer $z$ satisfying the modular equation $$mz\equiv t\pmod{n}$$Once we have found $x$, as above, we may multiply both sides by $x$ to get $$z\equiv 1z\equiv (xm)z\equiv xt\pmod{n}$$",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2074181', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/126138/']}",jdg_309383

I've been researching for a while, and found some AWS services that could be used, but still none seems to be the exact match for that. The main one is AWS AppSync, but it sounds like an overkill, as I only need simple notifications. There are also some AWS IOT services, but this seems to be off topic.

Question:
My Arch Linux's systemd starts rpcbind automatically. What do I have to do to stop systemd to do this? There are no remote filesystems in /etc/fstab . The only thing I found why rpcbind gets started is that is supposedly wanted by multi-user target but there is no service in the directory. How can I figure out why it is really started?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","There is an open bug report on the Arch tracker . Your best be would be to mask the service: systemctl mask rpcbind.service See Lennart Poettering's series of blog posts, systemd for Administrators, Part V for details on masking: 3. You can mask a service. This is like disabling a service, but on steroids. It not only makes sure that service is not started automatically anymore, but even ensures that a service cannot even be started manually anymore. This is a bit of a hidden feature in systemd, since it is not commonly useful and might be confusing the user. But here's how you do it: $ ln -s /dev/null /etc/systemd/system/ntpd.service$ systemctl daemon-reload By symlinking a service file to /dev/null you tell systemd to never start the service in question and completely block its execution. Unit files stored in /etc/systemd/system override those from /lib/systemd/system that carry the same name. The former directory is administrator territory, the latter terroritory of your package manager. By installing your symlink in /etc/systemd/system/ntpd.service you hence make sure that systemd will never read the upstream shipped service file /lib/systemd/system/ntpd.service . systemd will recognize units symlinked to /dev/null and show them as masked.

","In set theory, if $B$ is a set, $\bigcup B$ is the union of all elements(*) of $B$. This is a short-cut for $\displaystyle{ \bigcup_{b\in B}b }$. And you're correct, $\mathcal P$ stands for the power set, so $\displaystyle{\bigcup{\mathcal P}A=\bigcup_{X\in {\mathcal PA}}X}=\bigcup_{X\subset A}X$. Which is clearly equal to $A$. For example, if $A=\{1,2\}$, then ${\mathcal P}A=\{ \emptyset,\ \{1\},\ \{2\},\ \{1,2\}\ \}$ and $$\displaystyle{\bigcup{\mathcal P}A=\emptyset\cup \{1\}\cup \{2\}\cup \{1,2\} = A }$$ (*) note that in set theory, all objects, including real numbers, vectors, matrices, curves, functions, sequences, etc... are sets, so it makes sense to take the union of the elements of a set.

What should I do to activate my write permission?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You are mounting the CIFS share as root (because you used sudo ), so you cannot write as normal user. If your Linux Distribution and its kernel are recent enough that you could mount the network share as a normal user (but under a folder that the user own), you will have the proper credentials to write file (e.g. mount the shared folder somewhere under your home directory, like for instance $HOME/netshare/ .

Question:
I did this circuit in my protoboard, and it worked for a while, but the quality sound was terrible, and suddenly it stoped working. Can anyone explain me in which part of the circuit i did something wrong? any sugestions to improve the sound quality and make it work? the transistors used are both BC546, and the microphone was acctually an input for an mp3 player, but i didn't found in the programam that i did the schematics, so i put i microphone.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","One obvious problem is that you forgot to power the amp.  Perhaps because of the double transistor gain stage, a little signal was making it onto the base of the first transistor.  Connect the 9 V supply to pin 6, and put a 100 nF to 1 µF ceramic bypass cap immediately accross the chip. Depending on the microphone type, it may need a weak resistor to power with the other side grounded.  Electret mics work that way.  Your circuit should work with a dynamic or piezo mic. This amp doesn't have a lot of gain, so whatever you get out of the speaker will probably not be that loud.  Still, even with a gain of 20 you should be able to hear something in the speaker when you brush your finger over the mic or tap on it. Are you sure the 9 V supply is really 9 V after powering that speaker?  The way you have it set up, you are putting significant DC current thru the speaker.  With only 4 Ω, it could be trying to put nearly 1 A thru the speaker.  If the supply can't handle that, the voltage will collapse and the amp won't work as intended.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/62327', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com', 'https://electronics.stackexchange.com/users/19817/']}",jdg_212001

Question:
I have an activity that gets some data from the internet in background while showing a progress dialog. When I get the data (or an error) I dismiss that dialog and show another one. If for some reason the website takes too long to deliver the response (15+ seconds for example), the phone will turn off the screen. Now, while the screen is off, if I get a response and try to show a dialog, there will be an error (WindowManager$BadTokenException: Unable to add window -- token android.os.BinderProxy@483fa968 is not valid; is your activity running?) The reason of this problem is simple: when the screen turned off, another activity came to the foreground (keyguard or something). Question: Now, whats the best method for invoking showDialog on an activity that we know that might not be running? (the activity was created but it's not the one the user is interacting with.. in other words, it's in stopped state). I believe a similar behavior would happen if I clicked home and changed to the Home activity. (Although I can't do this in my particular case because my activity would cancel the request and everything would shutdown correctly). I don't think that this makes any difference, but I reproduced this in Android 2.1

","If all you want is to find some solution of the ODE, well, then finding one particular solution $x_p(t)$ is enough. But that solution might not be the right one, if you have additional conditions (boundary values, etc.). Usually one needs to know all the solutions of the ODE, in order to pick the one that satisfies the extra conditions. The computation that you have reproduced from your textbook shows that $x_p(t)+x_c(t)$ is another solution of the same ODE (if $x_c(t)\neq 0$), so this indicates a way of finding more solutions than just $x_p(t)$. (The point here is that, as you have realized, only $x_p(t)$ gives a contribution $f(t)$ to the right-hand side, and adding $x_c(t)$ doesn't spoil that.) But that still doesn't really explain the main issue, which is that you find all the solutions in this way. This is where the subtraction argument comes in. Suppose you have happened to find one particular solution $x_{p,1}(t)$ while your friend found another one $x_{p,2}(t)$. Then the difference $x_c(t)=x_{p,2}(t)-x_{p,1}(t)$ will satisfy the homogeneous equation, since you get $\ldots=f(t)-f(t)=0$ in the right-hand side when plugging in. So two different particular solutions to your ODE can't be arbitrarily different; they can only differ by a solution to the homogeneous ODE. That's why you know all the solutions to your ODE if you know (a) one of them to begin with, and (b) all the solutions $x_c(t)$ of the homogeneous equation.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2174985', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/420251/']}",jdg_257951

Question:
There are plenty of questions and discussion about memory consumption of different python data types. Yet few of them (if any) come to a very specific scenario. When you want to store LOTS of key-value data in memory, which data structure is more memory-efficient, a dict or a list of tuples? At beginning I thought dict is more powerful than list of tuples and that power must come with some price, and actually an empty dict DOES occupy more memory than an empty list or tuple (see In-memory size of a Python structure ), so I thought using [(key1, value1), (key2, value2), ...] would be more memory-efficient than {key1: value1, key2: value2, ...} . Looks like I was wrong. Just fire up the following code snippet, and see the mem consumption reported by your OS. I am using Windows XP so that task manager tells me, a large dict eats up ""only"" 40MB Ram and 40MB VIRTURAL Ram, but a list of tuples eats up 60MB Ram and 60MB Virtual ram. How could that be? from sys import getsizeof as graw_input('ready, press ENTER')i = 1000000#p = [(x, x) for x in xrange(i)] # Will print 4,348,736 40,348,736p = dict((x, x) for x in xrange(i)) # Will print 25,165,964 37,165,964print g(p), g(p) + sum(g(x) for x in p)raw_input(""Check your process's memory consumption now, press ENTER to exit"") Update: Thanks for some of the comments below. I wanna clarify: I'm talking about memory-efficiency. And no, in this case no need to worry about key-value lookup efficiency, let's just assume my algorithm will consume them one by one via iterator.

","Your list of tuple s adds an extra layer. You have 3 layers of items: The outer list of length 1 million, so 1 million pointers 1 million 2-slot tuples, so 2 million pointers 2 million references to 1 million integer values while your dict only holds: The dict (including 1 million cached hashes) with 2 million pointers + extra space to grow the table 2 million references to 1 million integer values It's those 1 million tuples plus the list to hold the references to them that take up more memory than the 1 million cached hashes. There are some 50% more pointers involved here, easily accounting for the 50% more memory use you see. There is another downside to your list of tuples: lookup time. To find a matching key in the dict, there is a O(1) complexity cost. To do the same in the list of tuples, you have to potentially scan the whole list for a O(n) cost.

Question:
I have to find all the continuous functions from $\mathbb{R}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ such that for all real $x$,$$f(x)+f(2x)=0$$ I have shown that $f(2x)=-f(x)=f(x/2)=-f(x/4)=\cdots$ etc. and I have also deduced from the definition of continuity that for any $e>0$, there exists a $d>0$ so if we have that: $|2x-x|=|x|< d$, this implies that $|f(2x)-f(x)|=|-2f(x)| < e$.

But the terms $x_n$ alternate between $f(a)$ and $-f(a)$ and never decrease in absolute value. Contradiction.

","The C# compiler has no idea whatsoever that a BigInteger is logically an ""integral type"". It just sees a user-defined type with a user-defined explicit conversion to long. From the compiler's point of view, long long2 = (long)bigInt; is exactly the same as: long long2 = someObject.SomeMethodWithAFunnyNameThatReturnsALong(); It has no ability to reach inside that method and tell it to stop throwing exceptions. But when the compiler sees int x = (int) someLong; the compiler is generating the code doing the conversion, so it can choose to generate checked or unchecked code as it sees fit. Remember, ""checked"" and ""unchecked"" have no effect at runtime; it's not like the CLR goes into ""unchecked mode"" when control enters an unchecked context. ""checked"" and ""unchecked"" are instructions to the compiler about what sort of code to generate inside the block. They only have an effect at compile time, and the compilation of the BigInt conversion to long has already happened.

","There is actually a (subtle) difference between the two. Imagine you have the following code in File1.cs: // File1.csusing System;namespace Outer.Inner{    class Foo    {        static void Bar()        {            double d = Math.PI;        }    }} Now imagine that someone adds another file (File2.cs) to the project that looks like this: // File2.csnamespace Outer{    class Math    {    }} The compiler searches Outer before looking at those using directives outside the namespace, so it finds Outer.Math instead of System.Math . Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately?), Outer.Math has no PI member, so File1 is now broken. This changes if you put the using inside your namespace declaration, as follows: // File1b.csnamespace Outer.Inner{    using System;    class Foo    {        static void Bar()        {            double d = Math.PI;        }    }} Now the compiler searches System before searching Outer , finds System.Math , and all is well. Some would argue that Math might be a bad name for a user-defined class, since there's already one in System ; the point here is just that there is a difference, and it affects the maintainability of your code. It's also interesting to note what happens if Foo is in namespace Outer , rather than Outer.Inner . In that case, adding Outer.Math in File2 breaks File1 regardless of where the using goes. This implies that the compiler searches the innermost enclosing namespace before it looks at any using directive.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 12, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/125319', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/4490/']}",jdg_282061

Question:
Writing mathematics in a notebook is OK, but consider the following image: In LaTeX, I can write: $$y^2=\frac{1+2\sin^{-1}x}{2}$$ which displays as: $$y^2=\frac{1+2\sin^{-1}x}{2}$$ As you can see, the fraction is much larger and more readable. Is there a Mathematica command that will enlarge my fraction to match the LaTeX display style?

",There are a few ways to do this. The easiest is probably the switch off the script level changes that are taking place by selecting the cell bracket and setting AllowScriptLevelChange->False in the options inspector: For more subtle tweeking you need to leave AllowScriptLevelChange->True and adjust ScriptSizeMultipliers . For example with ScriptSizeMultipliers->{1.0} gives the same result since the multiplier is 1. By default you'll notice that the value is set to 0.71. So you can adjust the sizes to suite your needs by adjusting that value. These adjustments can be made by selecting the cell and going to the Options Inspector. When you find settings that you want to use regularly it is probably best to incorporate these options into a cell style and create your own stylesheet.,{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/67724', 'https://mathematica.stackexchange.com', 'https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/users/5183/']}",jdg_243999

Question:
How to prove the following trigonometric identities ? 1) If $\displaystyle \tan (\alpha) \cdot \tan(\beta) = 1 \text{ then } \alpha + \beta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ I tried to prove it by using the the formula for $\tan(\alpha + \beta)$ but ain't it valid only when $\alpha + \beta \neq \frac{\pi}{2}$ ? 2) $\displaystyle\sec\theta + \tan \theta = \frac{1}{ \sec\theta - \tan \theta}, \theta \neq (2n+1)\frac{\pi}{2}, n \in \mathbb{Z} $ For this one I tried substituting them with the sides of the triangle, but not successful to the final result.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Added (and corrected twice): $$\tan \alpha \tan \beta =1\Leftrightarrow \dfrac{\sin \alpha }{\cos \alpha }%\dfrac{\sin \beta }{\cos \beta }=1$$ Multiplying by $\cos\alpha\cos\beta\ne 0$, gives $$\sin \alpha \sin \beta -\cos \alpha\cos \beta =0 \Leftrightarrow \cos (\alpha +\beta )=0$$ This is equivalent to $$\alpha +\beta =\dfrac{\pi }{2}+n\pi,\qquad (\ast)$$ to which we still have to add the condition written above ($\cos\alpha\cos\beta\ne 0$), which means the constraint $$\alpha,\beta\ne\dfrac{\pi}{2}+n\pi,\qquad (\ast\ast)$$ where $n$ is an integer. Note: In the original equation $\tan \alpha \tan \beta =1$, neither $\alpha$ nor $\beta$ can be zero.  The combined conditions $(\ast)$ and $(\ast\ast)$ assures that. The identity $$\sec \theta +\tan \theta =\dfrac{1}{\sec \theta -\tan \theta }\qquad \theta \neq (2n+1)\dfrac{\pi}{2}$$ is equivalent to $$\sin ^{2}\theta +\cos ^{2}\theta =1.$$ Indeed, if $$\theta \neq (2n+1)\dfrac{\pi }{2}\Leftrightarrow \sin \theta \neq \pm 1 \Leftrightarrow \dfrac{\pm1}{\cos \theta }-\dfrac{\sin \theta }{\cos \theta }\neq 0\Leftrightarrow \pm\sec \theta -\tan \theta \neq 0,$$ then $$\sec \theta +\tan \theta =\dfrac{1}{\sec \theta -\tan \theta }\Leftrightarrow \left( \sec \theta +\tan \theta \right) \left( \sec \theta-\tan \theta \right) =1$$ $$\Leftrightarrow \sec ^{2}\theta -\tan ^{2}\theta =1\Leftrightarrow \dfrac{1}{\cos ^{2}\theta }-\dfrac{\sin ^{2}\theta }{\cos^{2}\theta }=1\Leftrightarrow 1-\sin ^{2}\theta=\cos ^{2}\theta$$ $$\Leftrightarrow \sin ^{2}\theta +\cos ^{2}\theta =1.$$",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/12047', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/2109/']}",jdg_294603

I know it's a bit short , But I have no idea at all how to solve such question .. I'd be very glad if you can give me some help HOW to solve it. Given fuction $f(x, y) = x - x^2 - xy^2$, and I need to find it's minimum and maximum value in the domain $D = \{(x, y) : x^2 + y^2 \le 4, x \ge 0\}$. How can I solve it?

","You do not have to use Lagrange Multipliers, although you should repeat this exercise in order to duplicate the answer using that approach. We are given: $$f(x, y) = x - x^2 - xy^2, ~~D = \{(x, y) : x^2 + y^2 \le 4, x \ge 0\}$$ We need to find all of the candidate Critical Points (CPs).

Thus, we have the seven critical points to test by plugging them in $f(x, y)$. For the four points where $x = 0$, the function value equals zero, so we only need to test the other three points.

Question:
I'm trying to understand the result of (*) . (+) in Haskell. I know that the composition operator is just the standard composition of mathematical functions- so (f . g) = f (g x) But: (*) . (+) :: (Num (a -> a), Num a) => a -> (a -> a) -> a -> a I'm struggling to understand this type signature. I would have expected to be able to do things like: ((*) . (+)) 1 2 :: Num a => a -> a= (* (+ 1 2)) What is the meaning of (*) . (+)'s type signature? I tried playing with it by something like (just matching up with its signature): ((*) . (+)) 1 (\x -> x + 1) 1 But that fails to compile. I'm trying to walk through the logical steps when composing these, but I'm not fully understanding how it's getting to this result (and what the result is ).

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I understand how you feel. I found function composition to be quite difficult to grasp at first too. What helped me grok the matter were type signatures. Consider: (*) :: Num x => x -> x -> x(+) :: Num y => y -> y -> y(.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c Now when you write (*) . (+) it is actually the same as (.) (*) (+) (i.e. (*) is the first argument to (.) and (+) is the second argument to (.) ): (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c       |______|    |______|           |           |          (*)         (+) Hence the type signature of (*) (i.e. Num x => x -> x -> x ) unifies with b -> c : (*) :: Num x => x -> x -> x -- remember that `x ->  x -> x`                |    |____| -- is implicitly `x -> (x -> x)`                |       |                b ->    c(.) (*) ::          (a -> b) -> a ->    c                          |             |                          |          |‾‾‾‾|           Num x =>       x          x -> x(.) (*) :: Num x => (a -> x) -> a -> x -> x Hence the type signature of (+) (i.e. Num y => y -> y -> y ) unifies with Num x => a -> x : (+) :: Num y => y -> y -> y -- remember that `y ->  y -> y`                |    |____| -- is implicitly `y -> (y -> y)`                |       |       Num x => a ->    x(.) (*) (+) ::  Num x                => a ->     x    ->    x                                        |        |          |                                        |     |‾‾‾‾|     |‾‾‾‾|                              Num y  => y     y -> y     y -> y(.) (*) (+) :: (Num (y -> y), Num y) => y -> (y -> y) -> y -> y I hope that clarifies where the Num (y -> y) and Num y come from. You are left with a very weird function of the type (Num (y -> y), Num y) => y -> (y -> y) -> y -> y . What makes it so weird is that it expects both y and y -> y to be instances of Num . It's understandable that y should be an instance of Num , but how y -> y ? Making y -> y an instance of Num seems illogical. That can't be correct. However, it makes sense when you look at what function composition actually does: ( f  .  g ) = \z ->  f  ( g  z)((*) . (+)) = \z -> (*) ((+) z) So you have a function \z -> (*) ((+) z) . Hence z must clearly be an instance of Num because (+) is applied to it. Thus the type of \z -> (*) ((+) z) is Num t => t -> ... where ... is the type of (*) ((+) z) , which we will find out in a moment. Therefore ((+) z) is of the type Num t => t -> t because it requires one more number. However, before it is applied to another number, (*) is applied to it. Hence (*) expects ((+) z) to be an instance of Num , which is why t -> t is expected to be an instance of Num . Thus the ... is replaced by (t -> t) -> t -> t and the constraint Num (t -> t) is added, resulting in the type (Num (t -> t), Num t) => t -> (t -> t) -> t -> t . The way you really want to combine (*) and (+) is using (.:) : (.:) :: (c -> d) -> (a -> b -> c) -> a -> b -> df .: g = \x y -> f (g x y) Hence (*) .: (+) is the same as \x y -> (*) ((+) x y) . Now two arguments are given to (+) ensuring that ((+) x y) is indeed just Num t => t and not Num t => t -> t . Hence ((*) .: (+)) 2 3 5 is (*) ((+) 2 3) 5 which is (*) 5 5 which is 25 , which I believe is what you want. Note that f .: g can also be written as (f .) . g , and (.:) can also be defined as (.:) = (.) . (.) . You can read more about it here: What does (f .) . g mean in Haskell?

Question:
I am trying to make sense of how to handle and manage an initilization vector and salt (when applicable) when encrypting and decrypting data using a symmetric encryption algorithm, in this case AES. I have deduced from different SO threads and various other websites that neither the IV or salt need to be secret, only unique in order to defend against  cryptanalytic attacks such as a brute-force attack.

","Storing the IV and Salt along with the cipher text is proper and a best practice. Hard coding the salt is not useful, being random is important, hard coding the iterations is perfectly okay but is typically much higher than 300 (in fact at least 1000 and you typically go much higher if your machine/usage can handle it as in 10s of thousands). Because I've seen so many bad (or old) examples of c# encryption from stack overflow cut and paste into open source code, I wrote a short bit of cut and paste encryption code Modern Examples of Symmetric Authenticated Encryption of a string. that i try to keep up to date and reviewed. It stores the iv and salt with the ciphertext it also authenticates the ciphertext and values included with the cipher text. Ideally though a better practice would be to use a high level encryption library that would handle best practices like the iv for you, however those typically haven't existed for csharp.

Question:
First I'll give an example of code that does what I want it to do. Then I'll give a second example of a small change that causes a problem. Working Example ofApp.h : #pragma once#include ""ofMain.h""class ofApp : public ofBaseApp {  public:    void setup();    void draw();    ofFbo fbo;}; ofApp.cc : #include ""ofApp.h""void ofApp::setup() {  fbo.allocate(200, 100, GL_RGBA);}void ofApp::draw() {  // Draw a red square to the FBO  fbo.begin();  ofClear(255,255,255, 0);  ofSetColor(255, 0, 0, 255);  ofDrawRectangle(100, 0, 100, 100);  fbo.end();  fbo.draw(0, 0);} This results in the following red square being drawn to the screen: Broken Example Now I add two lines to the top of the draw method, and I don't get what I expect. Here's the full code of ofApp.cc : #include ""ofApp.h""void ofApp::setup() {  fbo.allocate(200, 100, GL_RGBA);}void ofApp::draw() {  // Draw a blue square directly to screen  ofSetColor(0, 0, 255, 255);  ofDrawRectangle(0, 0, 100, 100);  // Draw a red square to the FBO  fbo.begin();  ofClear(255,255,255, 0);  ofSetColor(255, 0, 0, 255);  ofDrawRectangle(100, 0, 100, 100);  fbo.end();  fbo.draw(0, 0);} I would expect to get both a blue square (drawn directly to the window) and a red square (drawn to the FBO). But the red square turns black: It seems that calling ofSetColor before drawing to the FBO causes everything drawn to the FBO to be black. What's going on here?

","The GUI should not be updated from another thread since Qt creates a loop where the application lives, although python provides many alternatives for works with threads, often these tools do not handle the logic of Qt so they can generate problems. Qt provides classes that perform this type of tasks with QThread (low-level), but this time I will use QRunnable and QThreadPool, I have created a class that behaves the same as Process: class ProcessRunnable(QRunnable):    def __init__(self, target, args):        QRunnable.__init__(self)        self.t = target        self.args = args    def run(self):        self.t(*self.args)    def start(self):        QThreadPool.globalInstance().start(self) Use: self.p = ProcessRunnable(target=run, args=(user_input.displayText(), box))self.p.start() Also as I said before, you should not update the GUI directly from another thread, a solution is to use signals, or in this case, for simplicity, use QMetaObject.invokeMethod : def run(user_input, log):    text = """"    if user_input == """":        text = ""Please enter a value\n""    else:        text = ""Test""    QMetaObject.invokeMethod(log,                ""append"", Qt.QueuedConnection,                 Q_ARG(str, text)) To be invoked correctly this must be a slot, for this we use a decorator: class LogginOutput(QTextEdit):    # ...    @pyqtSlot(str)    def append(self, text):        self.moveCursor(QTextCursor.End)        # ...

","Here's a little more detailed example. I set up background colors to make it more obvious what's going on here. First, the colors: black - margins white - padding gray - the contents of the scrollview green - the scrollbar if it takes up its own space (I added this explicitly as a scrollbarTrackVertical for the two ""inset"" examples) Let's define two sections: ""content area"" - the stuff to be displayed in the scroll view ""padding"" - the space around the content of the scroll view Let's think about the two parts of the scrollBarStyle separately: inside - the scrollbar appears inside the content area (the padding wraps around both the content and the scrollbar) outside - the scrollbar appears outside the content area overlay - the scrollbar overlays the right edge of the section it's in inset - the scrollbar pushes the section it's in to the left, taking up its own space The layout xml appears

Question:
I have just updated to Xcode 8 and I now have two options for app signing, Provisioning Profile and Provisioning Profile (Deprecated). Why is one deprecated, and what is the difference between the two?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Update 2017/02/13 User interface for managing signing certificates and provisioning profiles has been changed at Xcode 8.3 beta 2 . Changed the user interface for managing signing certificates and  provisioning profiles. Certificates are managed from the Accounts  preferences pane by selecting a team and clicking Manage Certificates.  Automatically managing signing is recommended, however if your app  requires manually signing provisioning profiles are managed in the  General tab of the project editor. Use the Provisioning Profile  dropdown to import or download profiles. In addition it displays  profiles that match the current signing configuration of the target.  (28641027) Why is one deprecated? I think Its deprecated because the signing system has been rewritten in Xcode8. The signing system has been rewritten to include a new mode for  automatically managing signing assets, in addition to a dedicated  manual mode where the profiles for the target must be explicitly  selected. When automatically managing signing assets, Xcode will  create signing certificates, update app IDs, and create provisioning  profiles. For manual mode, only custom created profiles can be  selected and Xcode will not modify or create any signing assets. Xcode  now encodes profiles in the target using the  PROVISIONING_PROFILE_SPECIFIER build setting. This setting allows  specifying both the team ID and the name or identifier of the profile. There are some Signing relate known Issues with Xcode 8.1 you should known. So maybe we should not set Provisioning Profile in Build Setting tab, switch to General tab , and set in Signing category instead. If you set provisioning profile in Build Setting and enable Automatically manage signing in General tab Xcode will complain about that. What is the difference between the two?",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/39488782', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1038786/']}",jdg_263863

Question:
I'm trying to speed up my benchmark (3 tier web architecture), and I have some general questions related to Memcache(d) and Varnish. What is the difference? It seems to me that Varnish is behind the web server, caching web pages and doesn't require change in code, just configuration. On the other side, Memcached is general purpose caching system and mostly used to cache result from database and does require change in get method (first cache lookup). Can I use both? Varnish in front web server and Memcached for database caching? What is a better option? (scenario 1 - mostly write, scenario 2 - mostly read, scenario 3 - read and write are similar)

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Varnish is in front of the webserver; it works as a reverse http proxy that caches. You can use both. Mostly write -- Varnish will need to have affected pages purged. This will result in an overhead and little benefit for modified pages. Mostly read -- Varnish will probably cover most of it. Similar read & write -- Varnish will serve a lot of the pages for you, Memcache will provide info for pages that have a mixture of known and new data allowing you to generate pages faster. An example that could apply to stackoverflow.com: adding this comment invalidated the page cache, so this page would have to be cleared from Varnish (and also my profile page, which probably isn't worth caching to begin with. Remembering to invalidate all affected pages may be a bit of an issue). All the comments, however, are still in Memcache, so the database only has to write this comment. Nothing else needs to be done by the database to generate the page. All the comments are pulled by Memcache, and the page is recached until somebody affects it again (perhaps by voting my answer up). Again, the database writes the vote, all other data is pulled from Memcache, and life is fast. Memcache saves your DB from doing a lot of read work, Varnish saves your dynamic web server from CPU load by making you generate pages less frequently (and lightens the db load a bit as well if not for Memcache).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/4490140', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/449219/']}",jdg_162319

Question:
First of all, I know how to build a Java application. But I have always been puzzled about where to put my classes. There are proponents for organizing the packages in a strictly domain oriented fashion, others separate by tier. I myself have always had problems with naming, placing So, Where do you put your domain specific constants (and what is the best name for such a class)? Where do you put classes for stuff which is both infrastructural and domain specific (for instance I have a FileStorageStrategy class, which stores the files either in the database, or alternatively in database)? Where to put Exceptions? Are there any standards to which I can refer?

You can easily package only your production sources into a JAR by dropping src/test/java as a source root. One rule of thumb about class placement and packages: Generally speaking, well structured projects will be free of circular dependencies . Learn when they are bad (and when they are not ), and consider a tool like JDepend or SonarJ that will help you eliminate them.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/7596', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/917/']}",jdg_204955

Question:
Question: Let $A$ and $B$ be distinct points of a circle $o$ . What is the set of possible centroids of triangles $ABC$ with $C\in o$ ? Here is what I have:The angle at $C$ will always be the same as it is always subtended by the same arc as $A$ and $B$ are fixed. There are 2 cases: Either $C$ lies on the small arc of $AB$ or $C$ lies on the big arc of $AB$ . In the case where $C$ lies on the large arc, by looking at the possible positions of $C$ one can observe that at some point $C$ and $A$ are on the same diameter and at another point $C$ and $B$ are on the same diameter. Also, it is worth mentioning that the midpoint at which $c$ intersects on the chord $AB$ does not depend on $C$ and is thus always the same. One can observe, by determining various points that satisfy the criteria in a drawing, that the possible points $C$ all seem to lie on a smaller circle contained in the original circle $o$ . One can then guess that the center of this smaller circle is a possible center of homothethy mapping the smaller circle to the larger circle with scale $r_1/r_2$ where $r_1$ is the radius of the larger circle and $r_2$ is the radius of the smaller circle(I am really not sure about this). I am not sure what to say about the case where $c$ lies on the small arc and am not sure where to continue with the problem. Any help is appreciated.

","[This is just a translation of Carl Schildkraut's answer into synthetic language.] Note that the centroid of $ABC$ can be constructed by taking the midpoint $M$ of $AB$ and then taking the point $G$ which is $1/3$ of the way along $MC$ (closer to $M$ ).  This means exactly that it is the image of $C$ under the homothety $T$ with center $M$ and scale factor $1/3$ .  Since homotheties preserve circles and their centers, this homothety maps a circle with center $D$ and radius $r$ to a circle with center $T(D)$ and radius $r/3$ .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3034991', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/623336/']}",jdg_214657

Question:
It appears that default behavior for NSDateFormatter has been changed in iOS11. This code used to work and produced date formatter according to currently selected iPhone/iPad language prior to iOS11: _dateFormatterInstance = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init]; _dateFormatterInstance.timeZone = [NSTimeZone systemTimeZone]; Looks like in iOS11 we have to explicitly specify locale property for it: _dateFormatterInstance = [[NSDateFormatter alloc] init]; _dateFormatterInstance.timeZone = [NSTimeZone systemTimeZone]; _dateFormatterInstance.locale = [NSLocale localeWithLocaleIdentifier:[[NSLocale preferredLanguages] firstObject]]; Can somebody confirm my findings?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","This isn't a problem with NSDateFormatter , it's a change in how iOS 11 supports localization. Under iOS 11, [NSLocale currentLocale] only returns languages supported by your app's localizations. If your app only supports English (as the base localization), then no matter what language the user selects on the device, currentLocale will always return English. Under iOS 10 and earlier, currentLocale would directly represent the user's chosen language and region, regardless of what localizations your app supports. Classes such as NSDateFormatter default to using NSLocale currentLocale . So no matter what language your app actually supported through its localization, classes like NSDateFormatter would show text in the language set on the device, even it was different from the language being used by your app. iOS 11 fixes this inconsistency. While one could argue that this change breaks lots of apps that only support one (or just a few) language, it actually makes the app more consistent. To make all of this clear, consider an example. You create a simple test app with a base localization in English. If you run your app with iOS 10 and the device's language is set to English, you obviously see English text and you see dates formatted for English. If you now change the device's language to French and restart the app, the user now sees English text in the app (since that is its only localization) but dates now show with French month and weekday names. Now run the same app under iOS 11. As with iOS 10, if the device's language is English you see everything in English. If you then change the device's language to French and run the app, iOS 11 sees that your app only supports English and currentLocale returns English, not French. So now the user sees English text (due to the app's localization) and dates are now also still in English.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/46205763', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/274519/']}",jdg_274586

Question:
You hear a lot of claims that, once you include manufacturing and battery replacement, hybrids pollute more than an efficient, more conventional engine . Are there any end-to-end studies measuring any type of pollution for both types of vehicles, which demonstrate that one is superior, even when the manufacturing (and pollution to generate electricity) is included for consideration? Note, I'm not talking about comparisons to Hummers. Pollution to include CO 2 and other emissions commonly attributed to and regulation in relation to the combustion of gasoline in motor vehicles.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","If you asked about Nickel Metal Hybrid batteries, the answer would be extremely easy. A large amount of studies have been done with these, usually concluding that they have lifespan comparable to those internal combustion engine vehicles. To cite the 100,000-Mile Evaluation of the Toyota RAV4 EV study , The five-vehicle test is demonstrating the long-term durability of Nickel Metal Hydride batteries andof electric drive-trains. Only slight performance degradation has been observed to date with thehighest mileage vehicles. Test data provide strong evidence that all five vehicles will exceed the100,000-mile mark and SCE’s positive experience points to the very strong likelihood of a 130,000 to150,000-mile battery and drive-train operational life. This is achieved by full or mostly full range useafter every charge. EVs can therefore match or exceed the lifecycle miles of comparable internalcombustion engine vehicles. As such, the reduction of greenhouse gases is simply a net benefit for the environment. However, you asked for lithium-ion batteries. That makes the answer harder to answer. Lithium-ion batteries are used in hybrid cars since only very recently. Little information is available on the subject. Don't take my word for it. It's the first thing said in the only peer-reviewed study I could find on the subject , published in August 2010: Battery-powered electric cars (BEVs) play a key role in future mobility scenarios. However, little is known about the environmental impacts of the production, use and disposal of the lithium ion (Li-ion) battery. This makes it difficult to compare the environmental impacts of BEVs with those of internal combustion engine cars (ICEVs). The study made several assumptions that were favorable to ICEVs: Used a car more energy efficient than the average car sold in Europe in 2009. They used 5.2 L of gasoline per 100 km, instead of 5.7 L of diesel /100 km 6.6 L of gasoline /100 km. ""All expenditures for the exploitation of the lithium salts were allocated to the lithium salts, even though the saline brine yields other byproduct as well."" All the burden from production are allocated to the first life of each product even though the product might be reused or recycled. As explained in the study, this assumption heavily penalizes BEVs since recycling of electric batteries is high and since recycling of lithium is more energy efficient than production of it. In spite of that, electric cars perform far better than conventional cars on all four indicators (abiotic depletion potential, global warming potential, cumulative energy demand, and eco-indicator 99): In fact, the research concludes that All the facts taken together, the results of the LCA, the various sensitivity analyses, the modeling applied for EOL, the assumption for the used electricity mix, etc., suggest that E-mobility is environmentally beneficial compared to conventional mobility. The Li-ion battery plays a minor role in the assessment of the environmental burden of E-Mobility. Thus, a Li-ion battery in an BEV does not lead to an overcompensation of the potential benefits of the higher efficiency of BEV compared to an ICEV. They note, however, that it's not always necessarily always the case. A few very small and efficient internal combustion engine vehicles can perform as well as electric cars: A break even analysis shows that an ICEV would need to consume less than 3.9 L/100km to cause lower CED than a BEV or less than 2.6 L/100km to cause a lower EI99 H/A score. Consumptions in this range are achieved by some small and very efficient diesel ICEVs, for example, from Ford and Volkswagen ( 13 , 39 ). They also note that the means by which the energy is produced influences the how environmentally-friendly BEVs are. The study used the average electricity production mix in Europe to give a general idea. If electricity comes from ""an average hard coal power plant"", the environmental burden is increased by 13.4%. On the other hand, if the electricity comes from hydropower plants, the environmental burden is decreased by 40.2%. As such, as countries move toward green energy, the environmental burden of electric cars will decrease. The study does not address the cost of manufacturing the automobiles, but those costs are not significant. As a recent Argonne National Lab study concluded that, while hybrid cars cost more to produce, hybrid cars make up for their greater manufacture energy costs by being more environmentally-friendly on the road - especially if recycled materials are used in the vehicle's fabrication. To cite the study's conclusion, The energy use and GHG emissions that result from vehicle production and disposal of advanced-powertrain vehicles (HEV and FCV) may be greater than those for ICEVs because of (1) the use of energyi-ntensive materials in the fuel cell system of the FCV, and (2) the increased use of aluminum in both the HEV and FCV. However, the use of recycled materials can reduce these impacts. Conversely, the use of energy-intensive materials such as aluminum and carbon fiber composites does not necessarily increase the vehicle-cycle energy use and GHG emissions of lightweight vehicles; with a reduction in total weight, the results are about the same and could be improved with additional recycling. To put vehicle-cycle results into a broad perspective, we conducted a total energy-cycle analysis that included the vehicle-cycle, fuel-cycle, and vehicle-operation stages. Our vehicle-cycle analysis revealed that lightweight materials can reduce the weight of a vehicle and improve its fuel economy, but that production of these materials can be energy intensive if recycled materials are not used. Our total energy-cycle analysis further shows that, when examining vehicle technologies and lightweight materials on a total energy-cycle basis, there can be a significant net benefit in terms of energy use and emissions reduction by substituting lightweight materials for conventional materials.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/351', 'https://skeptics.stackexchange.com', 'https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/users/34/']}",jdg_171171

Question:
I'm using the Javascript API for Google Analytics Content Experiments and it seems like you have two choices: Run one experiment at a time and have Google assign the variation, which you can get using chooseVariation() , or Run several experiments at a time and assign the variation yourself using setChosenVariation() (1) lets Google control the number of users assigned to each variation, which I need, but I  have several experiments.  This seems pretty basic.  What am I missing?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I don't think you're missing anything. My understanding is that the GA Experiments API allows you to allocate a visitor to any version of a single A/B/N test with the Choose Variation command : cxApi.chooseVariation(); However, this function is only available if you specify the experiment ID when loading the api.js on the page. If what you want to do is to run several A/B tests on one page at the same time , this is really multi-variate testing and unfortunately this is not available 'out-of-the-box' in GA Content Experiments (it used to be available with Google Website Optimizer). You can still 'fake' it using your own bucketing, with code like : <!-- 1. Load the Content Experiments JavaScript Client --><script src=""//www.google-analytics.com/cx/api.js""></script><!-- 2. See if the visitor has seen an experiment already --><script>// loop through all active experiments server-side. cxApi.getChosenVariation( $experimentId );<!-- 3. Bucket the visitor if he isn't bucketed already -->// loop through your live experiments   cxApi.setChosenVariation(    $chosenVariation,             // The index of the variation shown to the visitor    $experimentId                 // The id of the experiment the user has been exposed to  );</script> You will need to decide whether you want a visitor to only view one experiment at a time or enter multiple experiments concurrently. The first option is probably more reliable but means you will have to split your visitor in quite a lot of buckets, meaning your tests will take a long time before returning a result. If you use the second option, you need to be careful : if your experiments are not independent, you won't be able to trust the test results from Google Analytics, as the statistical tests used in the Content Experiments assume independence. Even if your experiments are independent, you'll need to have an equal split among all variation combinations.

","Okay, I found the answer. Sometimes you just don't see the forest for the trees. First off, handling cases of blocked ports is trivial. A simple try/catch does the trick. I was simply confused by the way Chrome displayed that exception and didn't recognize it as such right away (I usually use Firefox). Secondly, the WebSockets API Specification explicitly states that If port is a port to which the user agent is configured to block access, then throw a SECURITY_ERR exception.

Question:
I just want to get the number of a file that may or may not be gzip'd.  However, it appears that a regular expression in sed does not support a ? .  Here's what I tried: echo 'file_1.gz'|sed -n 's/.*_\(.*\)\(\.gz\)?/\1/p' and nothing was returned.  Then I added a ? to the string being analyzed: echo 'file_1.gz?'|sed -n 's/.*_\(.*\)\(\.gz\)?/\1/p' and got: 1 So, it looks like the ? used in most regex's is not supported in sed, right?  Well then, I would just like sed to give a 1 for file_1 and file_1.gz .  What's the best way to do that in a bash script if execution time is critical?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The equivalent to x? is \(x\|\) . However, many versions of sed support an option to enable ""extended regular expressions"" which includes ? . In GNU sed the flag is -r . Note that this also changes unescaped parens to do grouping. eg: echo 'file_1.gz'|sed -n -r 's/.*_(.*)(\.gz)?/\1/p' Actually, there's another bug in your regex which is that the greedy .* in the parens is going to swallow up the "".gz"" if there is one. sed doesn't have a non-greedy equivalent to * as far as I know, but you can use | to work around this. | in sed (and many other regex implementations) will use the leftmost match that works, so you can do something like this: echo 'file_1.gz'|sed -r 's/(.*_(.*)\.gz)|(.*_(.*))/\2\4/' This tries to match with .gz, and only tries without it if that doesn't work. Only one of group 2 or 4 will actually exist (since they are on opposite sides of the same | ) so we just concatenate them to get the value we want.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 7, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/4348166', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/125380/']}",jdg_253857

Question:
I want to do background subtraction in a video file using OpenCV method. Right now I'm able to do background subtraction, but the problem is that I couldn't get the output in color mode. All the output after subtracting the background is coming in grayscale color mode :( . I want to get the color information to the foreground which is the resulting output after background got subtracted. Can I do it using masking technique?? like the following procedure which I'm thinking about. Capture Input  -- InputFrame (RGB) Process InputFrame Subtract background, store foreground in TempFrame (which is coming in grayscale :( ) Create a mask using TempFrame Apply the created mask to the InputFrame Get colored foreground as OutFrame I'm struck up with doing the masking using OpenCV. I'm just a very beginner in OpenCV. Please help me to overcome this. Thanks in advance.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Okay, I don't understand how TempFrame (your foreground) could be greyscale if you are using background subtraction. You must be using a very special algorithm. But assuming TempFrame is greyscale, then you would do this: cv::Mat mask = tempFrame > 0.5;cv::Mat outFrame;capturedFrame.copyTo(outFrame, mask); That is OpenCV 2.0 code above. The number 0.5 is a threshold, you'll need to set it to something appropriate. If you're not using floating-point images, you'd probably set it to 128 or something like that. This is the same thing in OpenCV 1.1 code: CvMat* mask = cvCreateMat(tempFrame.rows, tempFrame.cols, CV_8UC1);cvCmpS(tempFrame, 0.5, mask);CvMat* outFrame = cvCreateMat(capturedFrame.rows, capturedFrames.cols, CV_32FC3);cvCopy(capturedFrame, outFrame, mask);",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/2026752', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/237380/']}",jdg_198678

","Simply: you can't use this in initializers. The idea is to prevent an incomplete object from escaping - Nested(this) could do anything to your object, leading to very confusing and hard to understand bugs.

The same thing fails for field initializers too, in exactly the same way: private Nested _field = new Nested(this); Essentially, initializers are intended to perform simple initializations - fixing the 98% problem.

Question:
Possible Duplicate: Simple way to overload compound assignment operator in C#? I was playing around with events and thought events are weird. Why couldnt i just implement them in a generic class. So i tried to and found that i CANT OVERLOAD +=. From the language specs found here The overloadable unary operators are:    +   -   !   ~   ++   --   true   falseThe overloadable binary operators are:    +   -   *   /   %   &   |   ^   <<   >>   ==   !=   >   <   >=   <= += is not listed. Now, before you say theres no reason to overload += i'd like to bring up the fact C# has events which uses the += operator and the fact i tried to implement an event for fun and wanted to use the += operator. Now, i have a feeling someone will say thats why events exist, because it is the only reason. However i want to bring up you can use += with the TimeSpan struct. Go try it, var ts= new TimeSpan(); ts += ts; will compile and run. I looked at TimeSpan definition and i have no idea how it is allowing it. I saw a public static TimeSpan operator +(TimeSpan t); which looked suspicious but then i realize its for something like var name = +ts; like how you can do var name = -ts; for negation. So my question is, how do i use the += for my struct or class. It appears to be supported i just cant seem to find the documentation on it.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Events don't overload the += and -= operator. This is just hardcoded in the C# compiler which translates it into the add/remove methods of that event. You can only overload + and - which then indirectly overload += and -= . If you overload + then automatically x += y becomes overloaded to x = x + y . So for your type you don't need to put in any extra work. Just overload + and you'll get += for free. This of course requires the left side argument and the result type being compatible, but that's usually the case. The reason that you can't overload += separately is most likely that it creates strange semantics for reference types. If += modified the existing instance of the left side then the following code would behave strangely: MyClass x=new MyClass();MyClass y=x;x+=SomeThing;y has changed now too On the other hand with += meaning x = x+y this code creates a new instance which it assigns to x. And the original instance remains unmodified in y; In C++ on the other hand it is possible to safely specify a separate overload for += because you can overload the assignment and copy-constructor at the same time and use that to get the correct semantics.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/5202862', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/-1/']}",jdg_188375

Question:
I'm working on playing audio from an audio stream using VC++ with the QtMultimedia library. Since I'm not too experienced with Qt's libraries I started by reading in a .wav file and writing it to a buffer: ifstream wavFile;char* file = ""error_ex.wav"";wavFile.open( file, ios::binary ); After that, I used ifstream's .read() function and write all the data into a buffer. After the buffer is written it's sent off to the audio writer that prepares it for Qt: QByteArray fData;for( int i = 0; i < (int)data.size(); ++i ){    fData.push_back(data.at(i));}m_pBuffer->open(QIODevice::ReadWrite);m_pBuffer->write( fData );m_pBuffer->close(); (m_pBuffer is of type QBuffer) Once the QBuffer is ready I attempt to play the buffer: QIODevice* ioDevice = m_pAudioOut->start();ioDevice->write( m_pBuffer->buffer() ); (m_pAudioOut is of type QAudioOutput) This results in a small pop from the speakers and then it stops playing. Any ideas why? Running Visual Studios 2008 on Windows XP SP2 using Qt library 4.6.3.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As Frank pointed out, if your requirement is simply to play audio data from a file, a higher-level API would do the job, and would simplify your application code. Phonon would be one option; alternatively, the QtMobility project provides the QMediaPlayer API for high-level use cases. Given that the question is specifically about using QIODevice however, and that you mentioned that reading from a WAV file was just your intitial approach, I'll assume that you actually need a streaming API, i.e. one which allows the client to control the buffering, rather than handing over this control to a higher-level abstraction such as Phonon. QAudioOutput can be used in two different modes, depending on which overload of start() is called: ""Pull mode"": void QAudioOutput::start(QIODevice *) In this mode, QAudioOutput will pull data from the supplied QIODevice without further intervention from the client.  It is a good choice if the QIODevice being used is one which is provided by Qt (e.g. QFile , QAbstractSocket etc). ""Push mode"": QIODevice* QAudioOutput::start() In this mode, the QAudioOutput client must push mode to the audio device by calling QIODevice::write() .  This will need to be done in a loop, something like: qint64 dataRemaining = ... // assign correct value herewhile (dataRemaining) {    qint64 bytesWritten = audioOutput->write(buffer, dataRemaining);    dataRemaining -= bytesWritten;    buffer += bytesWritten;    // Then wait for a short time} How the wait is implemented will depend on the context of your application - if audio is being written from a dedicated thread, it could simply sleep() .  Alternatively, if audio is being written from the main thread, you will probably want the write to be triggered by a QTimer . Since you don't mention anything about using a loop around the write() calls in your app, it looks like what is happening is that you write a short segment of data (which plays as a pop), then don't write any more. You can see code using both modes in the examples/multimedia/audiooutput app which is delivered with Qt.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3426868', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/413397/']}",jdg_250952

Question:
So as of yesterday morning I hadn't a clue as to what OSGi even was. OSGi was just some buzzword that I kept seeing cropping up over and over again, and so I finally set aside some time to brush up on it. It actually seems like pretty cool stuff, so I'd like to start off by stating (for the record) that I'm not anti-OSGi in any respect, nor is this is some ""OSGi-bashing"" question. At the end of the day, it seems that OSGi has - essentially - addressed JSR 277 on Java Modularity, which recognized that there are shortcomings with the JAR file specification that can lead to namespace resolution and classloading issues in certain corner cases. OSGi also does a lot of other really cool stuff, but from what I can ascertain, that's its biggest draw (or one of them). To me - as a fairly new (a few years now) Java EE developer, it is absolutely mind-boggling that we are in the year 2011 and currently living in the era of Java 7, and that these classloading issues are still present; particularly in enterprise environments where one app server could have hundreds of JARs on it, with many of them depending on different versions of one another and all running (more or less) concurrently. My question: As interested as I am in OSGi, and as much as I want to start learning about it to see where/if it could be of use to my projects, I just don't have the time to sit down and learn something that large, at least now. So what are non-OSGi developers to do when these problems arise? What Java (Oracle/Sun/JCP) solutions currently exist, if any? Why was Jigsaw cut from J7? How sure is the community that Jigsaw will get implemented next year in J8? Is it possible to get Jigsaw for your project even though its not a part of the Java platform yet? I guess what I'm asking here is a combination of panic, intrigue and a facepalm. Now that I finally understand what OSGi is, I just don't ""get"" how something like Jigsaw has taken 20+ years to come to fruition, and then how that could have been canned from a release. It just seems fundamental. And, as a developer, I am also curious as to what my solutions are, sans OSGi. Also, Note : I know this isn't a "" pure programming ""-type question, but before some of you get your noses bent out of shape, I wanted to state (again, for the record) that I deliberately put this question on SO. That's because I have nothing but the utmost respect for my fellow SOers and I'm looking for an architectural-level answer from some of the ""Gods of IT"" that I see lurking around here every day. But, for those of you who absolutely insist that a SO question be backed with some code segment: int x = 9; (Thanks to anybody who can weigh-in on this OSGi/Jigsaw/classloader/namespace/JAR hell stuff!)

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","First understand that Jigsaw's primary use case is to modularise the JRE itself. As a secondary goal it will offer a module system that may be used by other Java libraries and applications. My position is that something like Jigsaw is probably necessary for the JRE only, but that it will create far more problems than it claims to solve if used by other Java libraries or apps. The JRE is a very difficult and special case. It is over 12 years old and is a frightful mess, riddled with dependency cycles and nonsensical dependencies. At the same time is is used by approximately 9 million developers and probably billions of running systems. Therefore you absolutely cannot refactor the JRE if that refactoring creates breaking changes. OSGi is a module system that helps you (or even forces you to) create software that is modular. You cannot simply sprinkle modularity on top of an existing non-modular codebase. Making a non-modular codebase into a modular one inevitably requires some refactoring: moving classes into the correct package, replacing direct instantiation with the use of decoupled services, and so on. This makes it hard to apply OSGi directly to the JRE codebase, yet we still have a requirement to split the JRE into separate pieces or ""modules"" so that cut-down versions of the JRE can be delivered. I therefore regard Jigsaw as a kind of "" extreme measure "" to keep the JRE code alive while splitting it up. It does not help code to become more modular, and I'm convinced that it will actually increase the maintenance required to evolve any library or application that uses it. Finally: OSGi exists whereas Jigsaw does not exist yet and may never exist. The OSGi community has 12 years of experience in developing modular applications. If you are seriously interested in developing modular applications, OSGi is the only game in town.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 8, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/7498540', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/892029/']}",jdg_284137

Question:
I have read a number of posts from SO and I understand the differences between filtering in the where clause and on clause. But most of those examples are filtering on the RIGHT table (when using left join). If I have a query such as below: select * from tableA A left join tableB B on A.ID = B.ID and A.ID = 20 The return values are not what I expected. I would have thought it first filters the left table and fetches only rows with ID = 20 and then do a left join with tableB. Of course, this should be technically the same as doing: select * from tableA A left join table B on A.ID = B.ID where A.ID = 20 But I thought the performance would be better if you could filter the table before doing a join. Can someone enlighten me on how this SQL is processed and help me understand this thoroughly.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","A left join follows a simple rule.  It keeps all the rows in the first table.  The values of columns depend on the on clause.  If there is no match, then the corresponding table's columns are NULL -- whether the first or second table. So, for this query: select *from tableA A left join     tableB B     on A.ID = B.ID and A.ID = 20; All the rows in A are in the result set, regardless of whether or not there is a match.  When the id is not 20, then the rows and columns are still taken from A .  However, the condition is false so the columns in B are NULL .  This is a simple rule.

Question:
Is it possible to manage child elements in a HBox, so that the sum of the widths of all child elements is equal to the width of the HBox? So that elements fill the HBox and no space is left. The height of the child elements is by default the height of the HBox, so how about the width? I don't want to calculate the width in my program. It would be better if the layout does this automatically, so that no calculation is needed.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","It depends what kind of children does the HBox contain. Some of the children may not be resizable nodes. However, generally speaking, you can use HBox.setHgrow() method and set the same Priority for all children of hbox. The explanation is in its javadoc: Sets the horizontal grow priority for the child when contained by an  hbox. If set, the hbox will use the priority to allocate additional  space if the hbox is resized larger than it's preferred width. If  multiple hbox children have the same horizontal grow priority , then  the extra space will be split evening between them . If no horizontal  grow priority is set on a child, the hbox will never allocate it  additional horizontal space if available. Setting the value to null  will remove the constraint. Additionally, if you are trying to obtain a grid-like layout then try out other layout options, for instance TilePane or FlowPane and maybe GridPane .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/22044487', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/2700206/']}",jdg_214876

Question:
I'd like to see an extension of this discussion of the age-old chi-sq vs. Fisher's exact test debate, broadening the scope a bit. There are many many tests for interactions in a contingency table, enough to make my head spin. I'm hoping to get an explanation of what test I should use and when, and of course an explanation as to why one test should be preferred over another. My current problem is the classic $n \times m$ case, but answers regarding higher dimensionality are welcome, as are tips for implementing the various solutions in R, at least, in cases where it is non-obvious how to proceed. Below I've listed all the tests I'm aware of; I hope by exposing my errors they can be corrected. $\chi^2$. The old standby. There are three major options here: The correction built into R for 2x2 tables: ""one half is subtracted from all $|O-E|$ differences."" Should I always be doing this? ""$N-1$"" $\chi^2$ Test, not sure how to do this in R. Monte Carlo simulation. Is this always best? Why does R not give me df when I do this? Fisher's exact test . Traditionally advised when any cell is expected to be <4, but apparently some dispute this advice. Is the (usually false) assumption that the marginals are fixed really the biggest problem with this test? Barnard's exact test Another exact test, except I've never heard of it. Poisson regression One thing that always confuses me about glms is exactly how to do this significance tests so help on that would be appreciated. Is it best to do nested model comparison? What about a Wald test for a particular predictor? Should I really just always be doing Poisson regression? What's the practical difference between this and a $\chi^2$ test?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","This is a good question, but a big one.  I don't think I can provide a complete answer, but I will throw out some food for thought. First, under your top bullet point, the correction you are referring to is known as Yates' correction for continuity . The problem is that we calculate a discrete inferential statistic: $$\chi^2=\sum\frac{(O-E)^2}{E}$$ (It is discrete because, with only a finite number of instances represented in a contingency table, there are a finite number of possible realized values that this statistic can take on.)  Notwithstanding this fact, it is compared to a continuous reference distribution ( viz. , the $\chi^2$ distribution with degrees of freedom $(r-1)(c-1)$).  This necessarily leads to a mismatch on some level.  With a particularly small data set, and if some cells have expected values less than 5, it is possible that the p-value could be too small.  Yates' correction adjusts for this. Ironically, the same underlying problem (discrete-continuous mismatch) can lead to p-values that are too high .  Specifically, the p-value is conventionally defined as the probability of getting data that are as extreme or more than the observed data.  With continuous data, it is understood that the probability of getting any exact value is vanishingly small, and thus we really have the probability of data that are more extreme.  However, with discrete data there is a finite probability of getting data just like yours.  Only calculating the probability of getting data more extreme than yours yields nominal p-values that are too low (leading to increased type I errors), but including the probability of getting data the same as yours leads to nominal p-values that are too high (which would lead to increased type II errors).  These facts prompt the idea of the mid p-value .  Under this approach, the p-value is the probability of data more extreme than yours plus half the probability of data just the same as yours. As you point out, there are many possibilities for testing contingency table data.  The most comprehensive treatment of the pros and cons of the various approaches is here .  That paper is specific to 2x2 tables, but you can still learn a lot about the options for contingency table data by reading it. I also do think it's worth considering models seriously.  Older tests like chi-squared are quick, easy, and understood by many people, but do not leave you with as comprehensive an understanding of your data as you get from building an appropriate model.  If it is reasonable to think of the rows [columns] of your contingency table as a response variable, and the columns [rows] as an explanatory / predictor variables, a modeling approach follows quite readily.  For instance, if you had just two rows, you can build a logistic regression model; if there are several columns, you could use reference cell coding (dummy coding) to build an ANOVA-type model.  On the other hand, if you have more than two rows, multinomial logistic regression can be used in the same manner.  Should your rows have an intrinsic order, ordinal logistic regression would yield superior performance to multinomial.  The log-linear model (Poisson regression) is probably less relevant unless you have contingency tables with more than two dimensions, in my opinion. For a comprehensive treatment of topics like these, the best sources are the books by Agresti: either his full-scale treatment (more rigorous), his intro book (easier but still comprehensive and very good), or possibly also his ordinal book . Update: Just for the sake of the completeness of list of possible tests, it occurs to me that we can add the likelihood ratio test (often called the '$G^2\text{-test}$').  It is: $$G^2=\sum O\cdot\text{ln}\left(\frac{O}{E}\right)$$ This is also distributed as a chi-squared, and will almost always yield the same decision.  The realized values of the two statistics will typically be similar, but slightly different.  The question of which will be more powerful in a given situation is quite subtle.  I gather it is the default choice by tradition in some fields.  I do not necessarily advocate it's use over the traditional test; I'm only listing it for completeness, as I say.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/29367', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/5186/']}",jdg_82677

Question:
Here is a puzzle that is supposed to help illuminate common knowledge in game theory. Three girls are sitting in a circle, each wearing a red or white hat. Each can see the color of all hats except their own. Now suppose they are all wearing red hats. It is said that if the teacher announces that at least one of the hats is red, and then sequentially asks each girl if she knows the color of her hat, the third girl questioned will know her hat is red. I understand the reasoning there. The first must have seen at least one red hat on the other two to say I don't know. And the second girl must have seen a red hat on the third, or else she would deduce that the first girl saw a red hat on her. What I don't understand is the necessity of the teacher. Everyone knows there is at least one red hat. And, if we start with common knowlege, they should figure out that everyone else knows that. So is the teacher only introduced if common knowledge is not an assumption? Source: http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/~gean/art/p0882.pdf

Question:
First of all, I'm studying orbits for a hobby: world building. Unfortunately, my mathematical abilities approach a ridiculous low threshold, which means I am stuck with reading the simplest explanations, which in turn leave me asking tons of fairly basic questions. Allow me to start with a simple point. I know that Kepler's Laws state that planetary orbits must always be elliptical. I also know that Earth's orbit varies from more elliptical to less elliptical, and that its less elliptical stage is nearly circular. So... what would happen if Earth did have a circular orbit? Why is it impossible for any planet (or moon, by the way) to orbit another body in a perfectly circular path?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","You've been given an answer, and it's perfectly valid, but here's something from a different perspective (less strict). A circle is really just a particular case of an ellipse. Take an ellipse, and change it, by moving its focal points closer together. When those two points coincide, what you get is a circle. It's still an ellipse, technically - one that happens to have both focal points in the same place, is all. So yes, you can actually have planetary orbits, or any orbits, circular. There's nothing forbidding that. It's just pretty unlikely that this will occur via a natural process. As indicated elsewhere, in the real world, all orbits and trajectories are a bit imperfect due to perturbations - whether they be elliptical, circular, parabolic or hyperbolic, they are always a bit perturbed by external factors. In many cases, perturbations are so tiny that you can ignore them. When a planet is orbiting the Sun, and the orbit is elliptical, the Sun will be in one of those two focal points; the other point has no particular signification. If you could circularize that orbit, then the Sun would be in the center of the circle, of course. Kepler's laws remain valid for a circular orbit: The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. Still true. A circle is an ellipse where the foci coincide. A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. Still true. On a circular orbit, the planet moves at constant speed, so the swept area remains constant per time. The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. Still true. The semi-major axis becomes the radius of the circle. You must understand that Kepler's laws now have more of a historic interest. They are not exactly at the bleeding edge of science anymore. During Kepler's time, it seemed reasonable to state that all orbits must be elliptical (in the strict sense of the term), but now we know that trajectories (including orbits, or closed trajectories) can be circular, elliptical, parabolic or hyperbolic, depending on a few factors. We also know that perturbations actually deflect all these trajectories a little bit from ideal shapes (but it's usually a very tiny effect). We also know that relativity makes all ""elliptical"" orbits more complex - they remain close to elliptic, but the whole ellipse keeps turning around the central star very slowly. All this stuff was not known during Kepler's time, so take his laws for what they are - a snapshot of the development of our understanding in time.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/8838', 'https://astronomy.stackexchange.com', 'https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/users/5504/']}",jdg_302453

","The problem is that your Element class has not overridden the equals and hashCode methods or these implementations are broken.

It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values x and y, x.equals(y) should return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true. It is transitive: for any non-null reference values x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) should return true.  It is consistent: for any non-null reference values x and y, multiple invocations of -x.equals(y) consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the objects is modified. For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false. From Object#hashCode method javadoc: The general contract of hashCode is: Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application. If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result. It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the equals(java.lang.Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.

Following the hint I get $$\begin{align}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}(e^{\alpha \cos \theta}\sin(\alpha \sin \theta)) & =\alpha e^{\alpha \cos \theta} \sin (\alpha \sin \theta) + e^{\alpha \cos \theta}\cos(\alpha \sin \theta) \alpha \cos \theta \\& =  \alpha e^{\alpha \cos \theta} \sin (\alpha \sin \theta) + \frac{dI}{d \alpha} \cos \theta. \\\end{align}$$ Is this correct so far? The answers in the question referred as a duplicate does not help. I'm in a course dealing with real values, not complex.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","First a correction: $$\begin{align}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}(e^{\alpha \cos \theta}\sin(\alpha \sin \theta)) & =-\alpha \sin \theta \, e^{\alpha \cos \theta} \sin (\alpha \sin \theta) + e^{\alpha \cos \theta}\cos(\alpha \sin \theta) \alpha \cos \theta \\\end{align}$$ Now\begin{align}\frac{dI}{d\alpha}&=\frac{d}{d\alpha}\int_{0}^{2\pi}e^{\alpha \cos \theta}\cos(\alpha \sin \theta) d\theta \\&=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{d}{d\alpha}(e^{\alpha \cos \theta}\cos(\alpha \sin \theta)) d\theta \\&=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\cos \theta \, e^{\alpha \cos \theta}\cos(\alpha \sin \theta)- e^{\alpha \cos \theta}\sin(\alpha \sin \theta)\sin \theta \, d\theta \\&=\int_{0}^{2\pi}\frac{1}{\alpha} \frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}(e^{\alpha \cos \theta}\sin(\alpha \sin \theta)) d\theta \\&=\frac{1}{\alpha} \Big[e^{\alpha \cos \theta}\sin(\alpha \sin \theta)\Big]_0^{2\pi} \\&=0\end{align} So $I(\alpha)$ is actually constant. So $I(1)=I(0)=2\pi$ So the answer is $2\pi$",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/409171', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/63560/']}",jdg_102975

","CPU gets a power on reset, and jumps to a defined point: the reset vector, beginning of flash, ROM, etc. The startup code (crt - C runtime) is run. This is an important piece of code generated by your compiler/libc, which performs: Configure and turn on any external memory (if absolutely required, otherwise left for later user code). Establish a stack pointer Clear the .bss segment (usually). .bss is the name for the uninitialized (or zeroed) global memory region. Global variables, arrays, etc which don't have an initializing value (beyond 0) are located here. The general practice on a microcontroller is to loop over this region and set all bytes to 0 at startup. Copy from the end of .text the non-const .data. As most microcontrollers run from flash, they cannot store variable data there. For statements such as int thisGlobal = 5; , the value of thisGlobal must be copied from a persistent area (usually after the program in flash, as generated by your linker) to RAM. This applies to static values, and static values in functions. Values which are left undefined are not copied but instead cleared as part of step 2. Perform other static initializers. Call main() From here, your code is run. Generally, the CPU is left in an interrupts-off state (platform dependent).",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/3393611', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/245762/']}",jdg_265571

Question:
From reading posts on this site I know there is an R function auto.arima (in the forecast package ).  I also know that IrishStat , a member of of this site built the commercial package autobox in the early 1980s.  As these two packages exist today and automatically select arima models for given data sets what do they do differently?  Will they possibly produce different models for the same data set?

","They represent two different approaches to two similar but different problems. I wrote auto.arima and @IrishStat is the author of Autobox . auto.arima() fits (seasonal) ARIMA models including drift terms. Autobox fits transfer function models to handle level shifts and outliers. An ARIMA model is a special case of a transfer function model. Even if you turned off the level shifts and outlier detection in Autobox , you would get a different ARIMA model from auto.arima() due to different choices in how to identify the ARIMA parameters. In my testing on the M3 and M-competition data, auto.arima() produces more accurate forecasts than Autobox for these data. However, Autobox will do better with data containing major outliers and level shifts.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/32742', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/11032/']}",jdg_142505

Question:
This question is inspired by the Georgia Tech Algorithms and Randomness Center 's t-shirt, which asks ""Randomize or not?!"" There are many examples where randomizing helps, especially when operating in adversarial environments.  There are also some settings where randomizing doesn't help or hurt.  My question is: What are some settings when randomizing (in some seemingly reasonable way) actually hurts? Feel free to define ""settings"" and ""hurts"" broadly, whether in terms of problem complexity, provable guarantees, approximation ratios, or running time (I expect running time is where the more obvious answers will lie).  The more interesting the example, the better!

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Here is a simple example from game theory. In games in which both pure and mixed Nash equilibria exist, the mixed ones are often much less natural, and much ""worse"". For example, consider a simple balls and bins game: there are n bins, and n balls (players). Each player gets to pick a bin, and incurs a cost equal to the number of people in his bin. The pure Nash equilibrium has everyone each picking a unique bin, and nobody incurs cost more than 1. However, there is a mixed Nash equilibrium in which everyone randomly chooses a bin, and then with high probability, there will be one bin with ~ $\log(n)/\log\log(n)$ people. Since OPT is 1, that means that (if what we care about is max player cost), if randomization is not allowed, then the price of anarchy is 1. But if randomization is allowed, it grows unboundedly with the number of players in the game. The takeaway message: randomization can harm coordination.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/2229', 'https://cstheory.stackexchange.com', 'https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/users/123/']}",jdg_142189

Question:
I'm trying to print out the value of argv at this point in my code, but when I try to compile it, I get warning: format ‘%p’ expects argument of type ‘void *’, but argument 3 has type ‘char ** .

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","So why don't you cast it? printf(""argv = %p\n"", (void *)argv);` The %p pointer is specified (POSIX printf() ; C11 §7.21.6.1 The fprintf function ): p — The argument shall be a pointer to void . The value of the pointer is converted to a sequence of printing characters, in an implementation-defined manner. Since char ** is not a void * , you need to do the explicit conversion.  The compiler isn't allowed by the standard to do the conversion to void * for you — the ellipsis notation in the declaration of printf() means that default argument promotions occur, but that affects only the float type and integer types smaller than int ( short , char , etc). On most machines these days, that's a no-op.  On the (long obsolete) machine where I learned to program in C, there weren't void * yet (too old for the standard), but the equivalent was char * , and the value of a char * address for a given memory location was different from the pointer value for any other type — the casts were not optional. Note that I'm assuming you intend to print the value of the address.

","Mark's answer is correct but could use a bit more explanation. The problem is indeed due to a subtle difference between how method groups are handled and how lambdas are handled. Specifically, the subtle difference is that a method group is considered to be convertible to a delegate type solely on the basis of whether the arguments match, not also on the basis of whether the return type matches. Lambdas check both the arguments and the return type. The reason for this odd rule is that method group conversions to delegates are essentially a solution of the overload resolution problem. Suppose D is the delegate type double D(string s) and M is a method group containing a method that takes a string and returns a string. When resolving the meaning of a conversion from M to D, we do overload resolution as if you had said M(string). Overload resolution would pick the M that takes a string and returns a string, and so M is convertible to that delegate type even though the conversion will result in an error later . Just as ""regular"" overload resolution would succeed if you said ""string s = M(null);"" -- overload resolution succeeds, even though that causes a conversion failure later. This rule is subtle and a bit weird. The upshot of it here is that your method group is convertible to all the different delegate types that are the second arguments of every version of Sum that takes a delegate . Since no best conversion can be found, the overload resolution on method group Sum is ambiguous. Method group conversions rules are plausible but a bit odd in C#. I am somewhat vexed that they are not consistent with the more ""intuitively correct"" lambda conversions.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/7745852', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/67824/']}",jdg_108231

","So let's go over this piece by piece. The $ is usually a reference to jQuery ( https://jquery.com/ ) which is a library of a lot of really useful JavaScript functions and things. $(document) This is what's known as a jQuery selector . Essentially it locates whatever you put into it, and wraps it in a jQuery object that lets you call various functions on it. In this case, it's wrapping the entire document. $(document).ready The ready function registers a jQuery event handler that will be triggered when the element (in this case the document, I'm not sure if it can be added to other elements) has completed loading. In this case, the callback function you pass into it will run as soon as the entire webpage has loaded and is ready to begin processing. If you don't do this, your JavaScript will execute immediately as it is parsed, which could cause problems if not all of your DOM is ready. $(document).ready(function(){    ...}); This declares an anonymous function that is passed in as the first parameter to the ready function. The contents of the function will be run as soon as the document is ready (as soon as the ready event has been triggered). console.log('Hello World!'); This will output the text Hello World! to the console. In the case of a browser, it will show up in the browser console. $(document).ready(function(){    console.log('Hello World!');}); So this code will print the text Hello World! to the browser console when the DOM, or web page, has finished loading and is ready to execute.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/45723967', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/5355343/']}",jdg_367467

Question:
Libraries such as OpenGL access the graphics card and can produce graphics programs, how does these libraries access the graphics card since they are implemented using C. According to what i've heard, C and C++ do not provide graphics features built in the language and producing graphics requires libraries. How then are these libraries written in C? The same question applies for sound also? Are additional features to C/C++ languages such as graphics, sound, internet access written in lower level languages and then provided to the C/C++ using libraries? I would be thankful for any summary which correct my concepts, or any suggested readings on the web or books.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","OpenGL is not really a library. It's a specification. The opengl32.dll or libGL.so you have on your system are merely very thin layers, that communicate with the GPU driver. According to what i've heard, c and c++ do not provide graphics features built in the language and producing graphics requires libraries. How then are these libraries written in c? The operating system offers functions to talk to the hardware. A driver uses those facilities to drive (hence the name) the hardware. For example writing a sequence A, B, C, D may make some particular GPU draw a triangle to the framebuffer. I explained those things already in On Windows, how does OpenGL differ from DirectX? and here How does OpenGL work at the lowest level? (I'm including a verbatim quote here): This question is almost impossible to answer because OpenGL by itself  is just a front end API, and as long as an implementations adheres to  the specification and the outcome conforms to this it can be done any  way you like. The question may have been: How does an OpenGL driver work on the  lowest level. Now this is again impossible to answer in general, as a  driver is closely tied to some piece of hardware, which may again do  things however the developer designed it. So the question should have been: ""How does it look on average behind  the scenes of OpenGL and the graphics system?"". Let's look at this  from the bottom up: At the lowest level there's some graphics device. Nowadays these are GPUs which provide a set of registers controlling their operation  (which registers exactly is device dependent) have some program memory  for shaders, bulk memory for input data (vertices, textures, etc.) and  an I/O channel to the rest of the system over which it recieves/sends  data and command streams. The graphics driver keeps track of the GPUs state and all the resources application programs that make use of the GPU. Also it is  responsible for conversion or any other processing the data sent by  applications (convert textures into the pixelformat supported by the  GPU, compile shaders in the machine code of the GPU). Furthermore it  provides some abstract, driver dependent interface to application  programs. Then there's the driver dependent OpenGL client library/driver. On Windows this gets  loaded by proxy through opengl32.dll, on Unix  systems this resides in two places:  * X11 GLX module and driver  dependent GLX driver  * and /usr/lib/libGL.so may contain some driver  dependent stuff for direct rendering On MacOS X this happens to be the ""OpenGL Framework"". It is this part that translates OpenGL calls how you do it into calls  to the driver specific functions in the part of the driver described  in (2). Finally the actual OpenGL API library, opengl32.dll in Windows, and on Unix /usr/lib/libGL.so; this mostly just passes down the commands  to the OpenGL implementation proper. How the actual communication happens can not be generalized: In Unix the 3<->4 connection may happen either over Sockets (yes, it  may, and does go over network if you want to) or through Shared  Memory. In Windows the interface library and the driver client are  both loaded into the process address space, so that's no so much  communication but simple function calls and variable/pointer passing.  In MacOS X this is similar to Windows, only that there's no separation  between OpenGL interface and driver client (that's the reason why  MacOS X is so slow to keep up with new OpenGL versions, it always  requires a full operating system upgrade to deliver the new  framework). Communication betwen 3<->2 may go through ioctl, read/write, or  through mapping some memory into process address space and configuring  the MMU to trigger some driver code whenever changes to that memory  are done. This is quite similar on any operating system since you  always have to cross the kernel/userland boundary: Ultimately you go  through some syscall. Communication between system and GPU happen through the periphial bus  and the access methods it defines, so PCI, AGP, PCI-E, etc, which work  through Port-I/O, Memory Mapped I/O, DMA, IRQs. Update To answer, how one interfaces the actual hardware from a C program say a OS kernel and/or driver written in C: The C standard itself treats addresses as something purely abstract. You can cast a pointer to uintptr_t, but the numerical value you get is only required to adhere to pointer arithmetic if cast back to the pointer. Otherwise the value may be unrelated to address space. The only safe way to implement hardware access to C is by writing the lowest level stuff in assembly, following the ABI of the used C implementation and system. That's how all proper OS do it. Never addresses are cast into pointers in C! The operating system has implemented this in assembler, matched to the C compiler of the system. The code written in assembly is exported as functions callable in C. The kernel provides those functions then to the GPU driver. So the chain is: Application Program → [OpenGL API layer → Vendor OpenGL implementation] → GPU driver → OS kernel → Hardware.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/7967073', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/1023732/']}",jdg_168321

Question:
I read that on Unix systems, malloc can return a non-NULL pointer even if the memory is not actually available, and trying to use the memory later on will trigger an error. Since I cannot catch such an error by checking for NULL, I wonder how useful it is to check for NULL at all? On a related note, Herb Sutter says that handling C++ memory errors is futile, because the system will go into spasms of paging long before an exception will actually occur. Does this apply to malloc as well?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Quoting Linux manuals : By  default,  Linux  follows an optimistic memory allocation strategy.  This means that when malloc() returns non- NULL there is no  guarantee that  the memory really is available.  This is a really bad bug.  In case it turns out that the system is out of memory, one or more  processes will  be  killed by the infamous OOM killer.  In case Linux is employed under circumstances where it would be less desirable to suddenly lose  some randomly  picked processes, and moreover the kernel version is sufficiently recent, one can switch off this overcommitting behavior  using a command like: # echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory You ought to check for NULL return, especially on 32-bit systems, as the process address space could be exhausted far before the RAM: on 32-bit Linux for example, user processes might have usable address space of 2G - 3G as opposed to over 4G of total RAM. On 64-bit systems it might be useless to check the malloc return code, but might be considered good practice anyway, and it does make your program more portable. And, remember, dereferencing the null pointer kills your process certainly; some swapping might not hurt much compared to that. If malloc happens to return NULL when one tries to allocate only a small amount of memory, then one must be cautious when trying to recover from the error condition as any subsequent malloc can fail too, until enough memory is available. The default C++ operator new is often a wrapper over the same allocation mechanisms employed by malloc() .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/7947849', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/252000/']}",jdg_81378

Question:
I had my exam of linear algebra today and one of the questions was this one. Given $n\ge2$ and $ A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ , prove that: $$\mathrm{adj}(\mathrm{adj}(A)) = (\mathrm{det}(A))^{n-2} \cdot A.$$ Of course I was not able to prove this identity, otherwise I wouldn't post it here. But I'm still curious how one can prove this identity. Could someone point me in the right direction?

","We use the identities $$\tag 1\operatorname{adj}(A)\cdot A=\det A \cdot I_n$$and $$\tag 2\operatorname{adj}(AB)=\operatorname{adj}(B)\cdot \operatorname{adj}(A).$$We have by (1) $$\operatorname{adj}(\operatorname{adj}(A)\cdot A)=(\det A)^{n-1}\cdot I_n$$and using (2)$$\operatorname{adj}(A)\cdot \operatorname{adj}(\operatorname{adj}(A))=(\det A)^{n-1}I_n.$$Multiplying by $A$ we get $$\det A \cdot I_n \cdot \operatorname{adj}(\operatorname{adj}(A))=(\det A)^{n-1}\cdot A.$$If $\det A\neq 0$, we get the wanted equality, otherwise it's clear if $n\geq 2$.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/92837', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/-1/']}",jdg_293230

Question:
I am having a hard time making the title of a legend center-aligned relative to the legend keys when the legend title is long. There is a question from a year ago that works for short titles, but it doesn't seem to work for long ones. Example, first with a short legend title: library(ggplot2)ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Petal.Width)) + geom_point(size = 3) +  scale_color_distiller(palette = ""YlGn"", type = ""seq"", direction = -1,                        name = ""A"") +  theme(legend.title.align = 0.5) Everything is as expected, the legend title is centered above the legend key. Now the same with a long legend title: ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Petal.Width)) + geom_point(size = 3) +  scale_color_distiller(palette = ""YlGn"", type = ""seq"", direction = -1,                        name = ""Long legend heading\nShould be centered"") +  theme(legend.title.align = 0.5) We can see that the text is center aligned to itself but not relative to the legend key. I have tried modifying other theme options, such as legend.justification = ""center"" , but none seem to move the key from its left-most position in the legend box. A couple of comments: I'm running the development version of ggplot2, v2.2.1.9000 from a few days ago. I specifically need a solution for a continuous colorscale palette.

","Update Oct. 4, 2019: A while back I wrote a fairly general function based on the original idea I posted here almost two years ago. The function is on github here but it's not part of any officially published package. It is defined as follows: align_legend <- function(p, hjust = 0.5){  # extract legend  g <- cowplot::plot_to_gtable(p)  grobs <- g$grobs  legend_index <- which(sapply(grobs, function(x) x$name) == ""guide-box"")  legend <- grobs[[legend_index]]  # extract guides table  guides_index <- which(sapply(legend$grobs, function(x) x$name) == ""layout"")  # there can be multiple guides within one legend box    for (gi in guides_index) {    guides <- legend$grobs[[gi]]    # add extra column for spacing    # guides$width[5] is the extra spacing from the end of the legend text    # to the end of the legend title. If we instead distribute it by `hjust:(1-hjust)` on    # both sides, we get an aligned legend    spacing <- guides$width[5]    guides <- gtable::gtable_add_cols(guides, hjust*spacing, 1)    guides$widths[6] <- (1-hjust)*spacing    title_index <- guides$layout$name == ""title""    guides$layout$l[title_index] <- 2    # reconstruct guides and write back    legend$grobs[[gi]] <- guides  }  # reconstruct legend and write back  g$grobs[[legend_index]] <- legend  g} The function is quite flexible and general. Here are a few examples of how it can be used: library(ggplot2)library(cowplot)#> #> ********************************************************#> Note: As of version 1.0.0, cowplot does not change the#>   default ggplot2 theme anymore.

Question:
I'm trying to figure out the best way to build an animated hexagon menu.Please, see the following image for better understanding: The hexagon burger button is in the center. Once clicked, it reveals the triangular shapes surrounding the burger button. The latter transformed into a cross to reverse the process and hide everything back to the how it started. My picture is actually missing one step in the very beginning. The first picture should only show the burger button just as the codepen demo. So my question is the following : Could you please me advise me on how you would build this hexagon menu animation from HTML to CSS through jQuery and others. What techniques would you use to make it happen. Keep in mind that whereas the codepen example is featuring simple icons, mine features triangular pictures which once hovered reveal a title with subtitle.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Here is an approach and demo for a Hexagon menu demo And here is an animated gif of the hexagon menu in action : Hexagon menu main features : responsive according to the viewport size ( vmin ). This can be modified by changing the width/height values to percentages (aspect ratio needs to be maintained see here ) Images (with the <img/> tag), titles and subtitles 6 menu items animated burger icon in a hexagon outline menu item boundaries are clipped to triangles so they don't overlap each other. This way, the click event and hover state are triggered only when the actual menu item is hovered/clicked (except for IE, see browser support at the en of this post) Can be featured over images, gradients or any non plain backgrounds The hexagonal layout : CSS3 2d transforms to make the triangles skewY() and rotate() the menu items are clipped to triangles with .tr and .clip , unskewed with .clip and unrotated with .content the hexagon shape around the burger is made with an SVG polygon (easier to make and better result than with CSS (see 1st version) The burger icon is made with a span and 2 pseudo elements Hexagon menu featuring Animation : the triangles are transitioned one by one ( translate() and opacity ) with the transition-delay property the ""bounce effect"" for the triangle featuring animation is made with the transition-timming-function and a cubic bezier curve the burger to cross animation is made by transitioning the 2 pseudo elments ( translate() and rotate() ) and fading the center elements background to a transparent rgba color Hover animations : the burger hexagon hover effect is made by animating the stroke-dashoffset property of the SVG <polygon> element. the menu item titles and subtitles are featured on hover using 3D transforms ( translateZ() ) and opacity. The images are faded out at the same time Used technology : the CSS is coded with the help of SCSS and Autoprefixer to make it easier to write, read and shorter. You can see the compiled CSS by clicking on the ""view compiled"" button in the demo (the compiled CSS is also available at the end of this post) SVG for the hexagon around the burger HTML for the markup plain JS to trigger the featuring animation with a class change on the container Browser support : I tested this menu on IE 11, chrome, FF and opera on a windows system. and the menu works on all these browsers. Chrome and FF render the font with blur (as seen in the animated gif made with chrome) and FF tends to make jagged sides for the triangles. IE 11 has the best quality output for the fonts and triangles but : it doesn't support SMIL animations and therefore doesn't render the hover effect on the burger hexagon the overflow property for the links is ignored and the boundaries of the triangles aren't maintained I used crossbrowser testing to test safari support and the hexagon menu works on that system too. For people who got this far, here is another link to the demo : hexagon menu And the full code with the compiled CSS : var hexNav = document.getElementById('hexNav');document.getElementById('menuBtn').onclick = function() {    var className = ' ' + hexNav.className + ' ';    if ( ~className.indexOf(' active ') ) {        hexNav.className = className.replace(' active ', ' ');    } else {        hexNav.className += ' active';    }              } * {  margin: 0;  padding: 0;}html, body {  height: 100%;}body {  font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;

Question:
let $ a,b \in \mathbb{Q^c} $ and define $b> a$ prove that there exists a rational number x where $ b>x>a$ I have seen this proof done in a few ways some in textbooks others on this site form similar questions but what i want to know is if this proof by contradiction proves this is true for any a,b. First since a,b can be any irrational number as long as they aren't the same im going to arbitrarily define $b\geq2$  and $a \leq 2 $ then start a proof by contradiction changing the argument into, Prove that there does not exist a rational number x between any $ a,b \in \mathbb{Q^c}$ since $ a < 2 < b $  We have that $2$ is not a rational number; clearly we have a contradiction but does this prove it for any a,b that are irrational or only when one is smaller and one is bigger than 2?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Yes, this uniquely defines the sine and cosine functions. In particular, let's write$$f(x)=\cos(x)+i\sin(x)$$where $i$ is the imaginary unit. Then, the sum identities will yield, after a bit of computation that $f(x)f(y)=f(x+y)$. This is somewhat tedious, but easy to verify. But guess what! The only continuous functions which can satisfy $f(x)f(y) = f(x+y)$ are exponential functions; to prove this, notice that, for integer $n$, it is clear that $f(nx)=f(x)^n$. You can use this to show that, over the rationals, $f$ is an exponential function (i.e. $f(x)=e^{ax}$).* Since we have $\sin(0)=0$, $\sin'(0)=1$, $\cos(0)=1$ and $\cos'(0)=0$, this implies that $f'(0)=i$. The only exponential function satisfying this is $f(x)=e^{ix}$. Extracting real and imaginary parts yields, uniquely, cosine and sine. *If you wish to be formal about this, it would be wise to prove that $|f(x)|=e^{\alpha x}$ first, then prove that $\arg(f(x))\equiv \beta x$ - you can avoid the issue of $n^{th}$ roots being non-unique in the complex plane by separating your argument into these two sections.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1078380', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/60353/']}",jdg_369126

Question:
I am creating a svg x-y-chart in d3.js. Is it possible to create ticks of different lengths depending on tickValue? I have made my own tickFormat function myTickFormat and use that in .tickFormat([format]) and that works fine because [format] is expected to be a function. But it is not possible to do the same with .innerTickSize([size]) , which expects a number. E.g. if I want the tick at value 70 to be longer I want to do something like this: var myTickSize = function(d) {    if (d === 70) { return 20;}    return 6;}; But when I use myTickSize as argument to .innerTickSize() : var yScale = d3.scale.linear();var yAxis = d3.svg.axis()               .scale(yScale).orient(""left"")               .innerTickSize(myTickSize); I get an Error: Invalid value for  attribute x2=""NaN"" error for each tick.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","The tickSize function can only accept a number as argument, not a function, but there are other solutions. The easiest approach? After the axis is drawn, select all the tick lines and resize them according to their data value. Just remember that you'll have to do this after every axis redraw, as well. Example: https://jsfiddle.net/zUj3E/1/ Key code: d3.selectAll(""g.y.axis g.tick line"")    .attr(""x2"", function(d){    //d for the tick line is the value    //of that tick     //(a number between 0 and 1, in this case)       if ( (10*d)%2 ) //if it's an even multiple of 10%           return 10;       else           return 4;    }); Note that the tick marks at the max and min values are also drawn as part of the same <path> as the axis line, so shortening them doesn't have much effect.  If you don't like that lack of control, declare the ""outer"" ticks to have zero length when you set up the axis.  That turns off the corners of the path, but the outer ticks will still have lines that you can control the same as the other tick lines: var axis = d3.svg.axis()    .tickSize(10,0) Example: https://jsfiddle.net/zUj3E/2/ If that doesn't work, google for examples of major/minor tick patterns.  Just make sure the example you're looking at uses d3 version 3: there were a few extra tick-related methods added in version 2 that are no longer supported.

Question:
I want to calculate an integral $$\int_{|z|=2}\frac{\sin(z)}{z^3-z^2}dz.$$ I am pretty sure that this is a pretty straight forward Cauchy integral, but what I want to know is this: what do I do different when I calculate over $|z|=2$ compared to if I were to calculate the integral over $|z|=1$ ?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","As pointed out by snar, the problem in your approach is that the obtained bound for the maximum depends on $n$ , that is $Y_n\leqslant M_n^n$ where $M_n=\max_{1\leqslant k\leqslant n}X_k$ . And it is a priori possible that $M_n$ converges to $1$ hence  taking the limit may lead to an undetermined form. For example if $X_i=1-1/i$ , then $M_n=1-1/n$ and $M_n^n\to 1/e$ . However, the previous configuration $X_i=1-1/i$ is actually almost surely impossible. The point is that for almost every $\omega$ , an infinite amount of $X_n(\omega)$ will be smaller than $1/2$ . This follows from the second Borel-Cantelli lemma applied to the sequence of independent events $A_n=\left\{X_n\leqslant 1/2\right\}$ .",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3402696', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/660809/']}",jdg_274465

","The plugin gives you a lot of additional information about the nature of the connection, the strength of the signal, etc. But depending on your use case you may just try adding simple online/offline detection functionality using Web APIs: connectivity.provider.ts: import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';import { Observable, fromEvent, merge, of} from 'rxjs';import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })export class ConnectivityProvider {  public appIsOnline$: Observable<boolean>;  constructor() {    this.initConnectivityMonitoring();  }  private initConnectivityMonitoring() {    if (!window || !navigator || !('onLine' in navigator)) return;    this.appIsOnline$ = merge(      of(null),      fromEvent(window, 'online'),      fromEvent(window, 'offline')    ).pipe(map(() => navigator.onLine))  }} This way you have this code working across both hybrid builds and PWA and also avoid additional binary functionality concerns.

","For apply new configuration the new pod should be created (the old one will be removed).

If problem was connected with error inside docker image, that you solved, you should update pods manually, you can use rolling-update feature for this purpose, In case when new image have same tag, you can just remove broken pod.

Question:
I've been very interested in trying out microservices/SOA as an architecture and am having a hard time conceptualizing how the integration between services would actually be done. I like the idea of using messaging to decouple the clients from the services, but don't understand how a system could utilize it exclusively. The typical async operations and pub/sub stuff obviously makes sense - scenarios like creating a new order, broadcasting data for reporting, etc. What I don't understand is whether people typically try to use messaging for common request/reply scenarios - for example, a user hits their ""profile"" page and part of the data that needs to get rendered on the page is from a user service. I know common messaging implementations provide REST-like reply/request functionality but is that often used for simple data requests? It seems more likely that microservices would both expose REST endpoints and also register with a message broker for different types of communication it will participate in, but all these presentations I watch of SOA and microservice architecture seem to suggest they only use one or the other.. Thanks for any elaboration/experiences!

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","I have posted about this before - but generally speaking, synchronous operations (for example, a user clicking a button and expecting some data back) are synchronous for a reason. That is to say, synchronous - not because of the technology used to process their call - but because of a built-in and generally inflexible expectation on the part of the user that things should happen in real time and not ""offline"" (even if there is no material difference most of the time). So, it's generally unwise to put any kind of offline or asynchronous technology stack in between a user and their expected response. As with all things, exceptions abound (and could spawn a whole new conversation), but certain types of user calls can and should be handled ""off-line"" depending on the situation. However, I do feel that the focus of your assertion: I like the idea of using messaging to decouple the clients from the  services misses the point somewhat. We don't actually want to decouple clients (or consumers) and services. We would expect a client for, say, the Accounts Payable business capability to be highly coupled to the accounts payable microservice. Similarly we would expect a high degree of coupling between a service endpoint signature bool ProcessTransaction(Transaction transaction) and the consumer of such an operation. Where decoupling becomes really important is decoupling between services which support different business capabilities. And it's here that the benefits of messaging really make a difference.

Question:
The Problem Consider the following controller hierarchy: UINavigationController UIViewController UITableViewController The presence of the UIViewController is affecting layout. Without it, the UITableViewController takes up the entire bounds of the UINavigationController : However, if I add a vanilla UIViewController between the UINavigationController and UITableViewController , a 20px gap appears between the top of the UIViewController and the top of the UITableViewController : Even if I reduce my code down to the simplest possible thing, I still observe this behavior. Consider this app delegate code: public override bool FinishedLaunching(UIApplication app, NSDictionary options){    window = new UIWindow(UIScreen.MainScreen.Bounds);    var tableView = new UITableViewController();    var intermediateView = new UIViewController();    var navigation = new UINavigationController(intermediateView);    navigation.View.BackgroundColor = UIColor.Red;    intermediateView.View.BackgroundColor = UIColor.Green;    tableView.View.BackgroundColor = UIColor.Blue;    intermediateView.AddChildViewController(tableView);    intermediateView.View.AddSubview(tableView.View);    tableView.DidMoveToParentViewController(intermediateView);    window.RootViewController  = navigation;    window.MakeKeyAndVisible();    return true;} The above still shows a 20px gap between the top of the UIView and the top of the UITableView . My Understanding of the Problem I understand that something is erroneously allocating space for a status bar. Using Reveal I can see that the Frame of the UITableViewController has a Y value of 20 . Things I've Tried Unsuccessful Set WantsFullScreenLayout to true on the UIViewController , UITableViewController , and both Playing with EdgesForExtendedLayout and ExtendedLayoutIncludesOpaqueBars for both the UIViewController and UITableViewController Played with AutomaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets on the UIViewController Played with PreservesSuperviewLayoutMargins in the UITableView Tried overriding PrefersStatusBarHidden and returning true in both the UIViewController and UITableViewController Successful Overriding ViewDidLayoutSubviews in my UITableViewController thusly: public override void ViewDidLayoutSubviews(){    base.ViewDidLayoutSubviews();    this.View.Frame = this.View.Superview.Bounds;} Things I want to know is there a clean(er) way of achieving my goal? what is actually responsible for adding the 20px gap? The UIViewController ? The UITableViewController ? what are the best practices for ensuring my view controllers remain usable in different contexts? Presumably overriding ViewDidLayoutSubviews couples my view controller to expectations as to where it will be displayed in the visual tree. If it were to be hosted higher up the controller stack, things would not look right. Is there a way to avoid this coupling and thus increase reusability?

","The behaviour you are seeing is not a bug at all but merely a side effect of your misuse of adding views into a hierarchy. When you add the tableView into a view you need to tell UIKit how you want that tableView to size relative to its parent. You have two options: Auto-Layout or Autoresizing Masks. Without describing how you want your view to layout UIKit simply pops it onto the hierarchy and the default implementation will lay your view under the top layout guide (which just happens to be the height of the status bar). Something as simple as this would do the trick: tableVC.View.Frame = rootVC.View.BoundstableVC.View.Autoresizingmask = UIViewAutoresizing.FlexibleWidthtableVC.View.TranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = true// always nice to explicitly use auto layout This behavior is not actually exclusive to UITableViewController but also to UICollectionViewController . I believe their default viewLoading implementation insets the view under the status bar. If we make our childController a simple UIViewController subclass none of this behaviour is exhibited. Don't see this as a bug though, if you explicitly declare how you want their respective views to be laid out you won't have this issue.

Question:
Problems: It is fairly simple: we have a list of numbers $x_1, x_2, \ldots,x_n,\ldots, x_m$. Our goal is to randomly and uniformly choose a subset of $n$ many numbers out of these. This means that, for any $i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n,\ldots,m\}$, the probability of choosing the value of $x_i$ must be:$$n\frac{1}{m} = \frac{n}{m}$$ An algorithm: An instruction is $\text{swap}(x_{\text{left}},x_{\text{right}})$. It simply swaps their values. I.e. $t := x_{\text{left}}$ $x_{\text{left}} := x_{\text{right}}$ $x_{\text{right}} := t$ A suggested algorithm is: for each $i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, randomly and uniformly choose some $k_i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n, \ldots, m\}$, and then execute $\text{swap}(x_i, x_{k_i})$. Then return $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ as the set of $n$-many chosen numbers. The challenge: Intuitively, that algorithm looks to me to be perfectly fine. I see absolutely no problem in it. But when I try to look at it mathematically, I fail to prove it. Instead, I actually seem to be prove that it is not a correct solution! First, let's look at the probability of choosing the first $n$ numbers: For any $i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, $x_i$ can be chosen if: $x_i$ exists in the right hand of $\text{swap}$. There are exactly $n$ cases, including the case when $x_i$ exists in, both, the left and the right hands. $x_i$ exists in the left hand, such that there exists $x_j$ in the right hand such that $j \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. There are exactly $n$ such cases, one of which is the case when $i=j$ which we have counted earlier. Therefore, to avoid counting the case of $i=j$ twice, we assume that there are $n-1$ cases. There is no other case where $x_i$ is chosen. Therefore the probability of choosing a number $x_i$, given that $i \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ is:$$\frac{n + (n-1)}{m^2}$$ Now, let's look at the probability of choosing the reset of the numbers up to $m$: For any $i \in \{n+1,n+2,\ldots,m\}$, $x_i$ can be chosen if: $x_i$ exists in the right hand, such that there exists $x_j$ in the right hand such that $j \in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. There are exactly $n$ such cases. There is no other case of having $x_i$ chosen. So the probability of choosing $x_i$ is:$$\frac{n}{m^2}$$ Comparing the probabilities: That says that there is a bias. The probability of choosing the 1st $n$ numbers is higher than the probability of choosing the reset of the numbers up to the $m^{th}$ My question: Where did I go wrong? How to address this problem?

","The ""suggested algorithm"" is incorrect. One way to see why that is so is to count the number of equiprobable permutations performed by the algorithm.  At each step there are $m$ possible values for $k$, whence after $n$ steps there are $m^n$ possible results.  Although many results will be duplicated, the point is that the probability of outputting any particular permutation must be a multiple of $m^{-n}$.  However, the correct probability, $1/m!$, is rarely such a multiple.  For instance, with $m=3$ and $n=2$ you will produce $3^2=9$ possible permutations, each with chance $1/9$, but there are only $m!=6$ distinct permutations.  Since $1/6$ is not a multiple of $1/9$, none of the permutations will be produced with a chance of $1/6$. There are better ways. One is ""Algorithm P"" from Knuth's Seminumerical Algorithms , section 3.4.2: for i := 1 to n do    Swap(x[i], x[RandInt(i,m)]) The proof that this works is by induction on $m$. Obviously it works in the base case (either $m=0$ or $m=1$, as you prefer). In the first step, every $x_k$ has an equal chance of being moved into the first position.  The algorithm proceeds to work recursively and independently on the elements in positions $2$ through $n$, where by the inductive hypothesis every one of those elements has an equal and independent chance of appearing anywhere among the first $n-1$ positions.  Consequently all $m$ of the elements of $x$ have equal and independent chances of appearing among the first $n$ positions when the algorithm terminates, QED . Knuth's Algorithm S guarantees the output will be in the order in which they originally appeared in $x$: Select := nRemaining := mfor i := 1 to m do    if RandReal(0,1) * Remaining < Select then        output x[i]        Select--    Remaining-- Exercises (2), (3), and (4) in that section ask the reader to prove this algorithm works.  Once again the proof is an induction on $m$. When $m=n=1$, $x$ itself is always returned. Otherwise, $x_1$ will be output with probability $n/m$ in the first step, which is the correct probability, and the algorithm proceeds recursively to output $n-1$ elements of $x_{-1} = (x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_m)$ in sorted order if $x_1$ was output and otherwise will output $n$ elements of $x_{-1}$ in sorted order, QED . If you would like to follow along, here is an executable version in R , along with a quick simulation to verify that all elements of $x$ have equal chances of being included. algorithm.S <- function(x, n=1) {  m <- length(x)  #  # Check input.  #  if (n < 0 || n > m) stop(""Subset size out of range."")  #  # Handle special cases that R has trouble with.  #  if (m <= 1)     if (n==0) return (x[c()]) else return(x)  #  # The algorithm.  #  y <- x[1:n]  select <- n  remaining <- m  j <- 0  for (i in 1:m) {    if (runif(1) * remaining < select) {      j <- j+1; y[j] <- i      select <- select-1    }    remaining <- remaining-1  }  return(y)}x <- 1:10sim <- replicate(1e4, algorithm.S(x, 4))hist(sim, breaks=seq(min(x)-1/2, max(x)+1/2, by=1))",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/228199', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com', 'https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/100507/']}",jdg_182169

","I assume you mean XBAP (XAML Browser Application) with WBA? Silverlight and XBAP are pretty similar to each other but they do have some major differences. The largest of these is most likely the fact that XBAPs run on top of the full .Net framework while Silverlight uses a stripped down version of the CLR and class libraries. This results in Silverlight lacking some of the features that WPF has which are available in XBAPs. Also it is worth understanding that XBAPs are technically ClickOnce applications and as such they are installed to the user's computer. This happens automatically and the user doesn't necessarily understand that - but at least for me, if I saw a XBAP loading from a random web site, I would most likely cancel it and go to another site. XBAPs also require IE or Firefox and the .Net framework they are built for. Silverlight requires only the Silverlight player which is available for IE, Firefox and Safari and works on Windows and OSX and is much smaller than the full .Net framework in terms of download size. This said, I prefer XBAPs if I know that the limitations are not an issue. If I was developing an application for intranet use, I'd go with a XBAP as it provides more versatile framework. If the application was to be deployed in the internet, I'd use Silverlight to reach as many users as possible.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/811121', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/72858/']}",jdg_323433

","Explanation Lets take a look at your code and some modified examples: // Example 1byte byteValue = 2;// Example 2byte byteValue = 4/2;// Example 3byte byteValue = 2000;// Example 4byte byteValue = 500/2;// Example 5int n1 = 4;byte byteValue = n1/2; Non-lossy conversion You will get the mentioned compile-time error for Example 3 , Example 4 and Example 5 . First of all, the simple math you have for Example 1 to 4 is executed at compile-time. So Java will compute 500 / 2 at compile-time and replace the code with basically byte byteValue = 250; . Valid values for bytes in Java are -128 to 127 . So any value outside of that range can not just be taken as a byte but requires explicit conversion. Because of that, Example 1 and Example 2 pass. Lossy narrowing conversion To understand why the rest fails, we have to study the Java Language Specification (JLS), more specifically chapter 5.1.3. Narrowing Primitive Conversion and 5.2. Assignment Contexts . It says that a conversion from int to byte (if it is outside of the range of byte ) is a narrowing primitive conversion and that it may lose information (for obvious reasons). It continues by explaining how the conversion is done: A narrowing conversion of a signed integer to an integral type T simply discards all but the n lowest order bits, where n is the number of bits used to represent type T. In addition to a possible loss of information about the magnitude of the numeric value, this may cause the sign of the resulting value to differ from the sign of the input value. From the second chapter, assignments with narrow conversions are allowed if the value is a constant expression . In addition, if the expression is a constant expression (§15.29) of type byte , short, char, or int: A narrowing primitive conversion may be used if the variable is of type byte , short, or char, and the value of the constant expression is representable in the type of the variable. Long story short, a narrowing conversion that may lose information (because the value exceeds the range) has to explicitly be announced to Java. Java will not just do it for you without you forcing it. That is done by a cast. So for example byte byteValue = (byte) (500 / 2); resulting in the value -6 . Constant expression Your last example is very interesting: int n1 = 4;byte byteValue = n1/2; Although this does not exceed the range, Java still treats it as lossy narrowing conversion. Why is that the case? Well, Java can not ensure 100% that n1 is not changed last second before n1/2 is executed. Therefore, it would have to consider all of your code to see if maybe someone accesses n1 sneaky and changes it. Java does not do this kind of analysis at compile-time. So if you can tell Java that n1 stays 4 and can actually never change, then this will actually compile. In this specific case, it would be enough to make it final . So with final int n1 = 4;byte byteValue = n1/2; it will actually compile because Java knows that n1 stays 4 and can not change anymore. Hence it can compute n1/2 at compile-time to 2 and replace the code with basically byte byteValue = 2; , which is in range. So you made n1 / 2 a constant expression , as explained before in 5.2. Assignment Contexts . You can check the details what it needs to have a constant expression in 15.29. Constant Expressions . Basically everything simple that can easily be computed in place without any method invocations or other fancy stuff.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 5, 'links': ['https://Stackoverflow.com/questions/62965830', 'https://Stackoverflow.com', 'https://Stackoverflow.com/users/12958034/']}",jdg_256590

Below is a question asked on the forum math.stackexchange.com. Provide a good and informational response to it like a helpful human would.

Question:
As opposed to the generic polynomial form for utilizing the Eisenstein Criterion ($a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\dots+a_0\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is irreducible in $\mathbb{Q}$) how do we prove that if $p$ is a prime, $x^{p-1}+x^{p-2}+\dots+x+1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$?

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Here is the standard proof, mentioned by Arturo and Gerry $$P(x)=\frac{x^p-1}{x-1} \,.$$ Then $$P(x+1) = \frac{(x+1)^p-1}{x} =\frac{ \sum_{k=0}^p \binom{p}{k}x^p -1}{x}=x^{p-1} \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \binom{p}{k}x^{k-1} \,.$$ It is trivial to show that $p| \binom{p}{k}$ for all $1 \leq k \leq p$ and that $p^2 \nmid  \binom{p}{1}$, thus Eisenstein Criteria can be applied. Since $P(x+1)$ is irreducible, we have $P(x)$ is also irreducible...",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 4, 'links': ['https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/87609', 'https://math.stackexchange.com', 'https://math.stackexchange.com/users/16895/']}",jdg_130812

Question:
I was reviewing suggested edits when I came across this edit . The original answer had a complete function , along with the code snippet (note that this is just a partial code, not the whole function) : FILE *secretFile = fopen(pathCString, ""r"");RSA *rsa = NULL;PEM_read_RSAPrivateKey(secretFile, &rsa, NULL, NULL); The suggested edit by a new user added a fclose(secretFile); , so that the function in the accepted answer does not leak a file descriptor. The change is not a trivial one, yes, so I actually did go through the trouble to verify that he is right, and went to accept the edit. But the edit had been rejected already with 3 votes stating that ""This edit changes too much in the original post; the original meaning or intent of the post would be lost."" The user, having just 1 reputation on SO, then had no other choice to report his findings as to post in a new answer with just one line of code changed from the original. Someone else could have been discouraged by the rejection outright, and this could have been unnoticed already; certainly not a way to commend a new user for a contribution. What is the rationale of rejecting this code edit? To me it was an exemplary one, and certainly not changing the intent of the post, unless the intent was to leak file descriptors. Furthermore it is not trivial knowledge that PEM_read_RSAPrivateKey would not close the file. Furthermore I hardly ever can even go through my 20 daily edit quota as the edit queue is almost always flushed, due to hordes of trigger-happy badge hunters. I have always skipped edits to code where I am not a domain expert, but this does not seem to be the case for the most reviewers. Even on Meta, many state that they outright reject any edits that touch any code, good or bad, if it is not for an obvious typo or formatting issue.

Now provide the response and nothing else.
","Given just the portion of the code that you pasted into the question here, I, too, would have questioned the necessity of adding the fclose(). However, seeing the entire function in your link, the fclose() is definitely necessary as the function is absolutely leaking the handle without it. secretFile goes out of scope at the end of the function and it isn't being passed to anything else that could close it later. The edit should have been approved, IMO. The only reason I could potentially see for not approving the edit would be if you instead added fclose() further up in the function than the user who made the edit did.",{},"{'log_upvote_score': 6, 'links': ['https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/254673', 'https://meta.stackoverflow.com', 'https://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/918959/']}",jdg_83257
