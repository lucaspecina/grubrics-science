Prior to the development of the flexible thermogalvanic device described in this paper, there were significant advances in thermoelectric and thermogalvanic technologies, particularly in the context of energy harvesting from body heat. Key technologies included:
Thermoelectric Devices: Traditional semiconductor thermoelectric generators (TEGs), while effective at converting heat to electricity, often faced limitations in efficiency, especially when dealing with low-grade heat sources like body heat. These devices typically suffered from low thermopower and were limited by rigid structures, which made them less suitable for wearable applications.
2. Quasi-Solid Thermocells: The emergence of quasi-solid thermocells, which used gel networks to confine liquid electrolytes, provided a promising alternative. These devices offered higher flexibility and better integration into wearable electronics. However, they faced a significant trade-off between mechanical robustness and thermoelectric efficiency. Enhancing one often compromised the other, making it challenging to achieve both high mechanical strength and high thermoelectric performance in a single device.
3. Materials and Molecular Engineering: The introduction of functional additives like guanidine hydrochloride (GdmCl) into thermocells improved the thermopower by increasing the entropy difference of redox couples. However, this improvement typically led to weakened mechanical properties due to the salting-in effect induced by the Hofmeister series, which negatively affected the polymer chains' interactions.
4. Structural Design Innovations: Attempts to overcome these limitations included reinforcing polymer networks through double-network designs or creating anisotropic structures via methods like ice-templating. These approaches aimed to decouple the mechanical and thermoelectric properties, but they often resulted in compromises, such as lower output power densities or reduced efficiency due to slow ionic migration.","Background Survey Summary

Development and Potential of Liquid-State Thermocells (LITCs):

LITCs have emerged as a cost-effective alternative for heat-to-electricity conversion, offering significantly higher ionic thermopower (Si) compared to TEGs. They rely on the thermogalvanic effect, where redox reactions between ions at different temperatures generate electrical power.

Solvent mixtures like acetone-water have been used to alter the solvation structure of redox ions, boosting thermopower. Advanced electrode materials, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, have also improved ionic transfer and system efficiency.

4,Tough and elastic hydrogel thermocells for heat energy utilization,2024/08/01,Chemical Engineering Journal,"Background Survey:
Hydrogel thermocells have emerged as promising candidates for converting low-grade heat into electrical energy, particularly for wearable devices. However, a key limitation in these systems has been the trade-off between mechanical toughness and elasticity. Hydrogels typically struggle to balance these properties—improvements in toughness often come at the expense of elasticity, which is critical for flexible applications.

Additionally, maintaining stable thermoelectric performance in hydrogels while improving mechanical properties remains challenging. Structural modifications that enhance toughness can disrupt ion transport, negatively affecting the hydrogel's energy-conversion efficiency.
