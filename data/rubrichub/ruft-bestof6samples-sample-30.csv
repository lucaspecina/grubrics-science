3. Solves a real, cool problem in people’s lives or work, something practical but original
4. Has potential for viral growth or clear product-market fit

Context: I like startups like Cal.ai (http://cal.ai) (AI calorie counting), Boardy.ai (http://boardy.ai) (AI networking), and AI scheduling assistants, things that automate or enhance daily life or work through smart AI tooling.

"Using a data-driven approach, compare the environmental sustainability, supply chain ethics, and transparency practices of three major global clothing brands: Patagonia, Uniqlo (Fast Retailing), and H&M.

Your analysis should incorporate and critically evaluate publicly available ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reports, third-party sustainability ratings (e.g., MSCI, Sustainalytics, Fashion Transparency Index), third-party audit summaries, and any documented controversies or labor/environmental violations from the past five years.

Specifically:
- Quantify and compare key sustainability metrics (e.g., Scope 1/2/3 emissions, water use intensity, % of sustainable materials, renewable energy usage).
- Assess supply chain ethics using structured criteria (e.g., % of audited suppliers, living wage commitments, forced labor safeguards, grievance mechanisms).
- Evaluate corporate transparency, including disclosure frequency, data completeness, and response to controversies.

Use data analysis techniques such as table-based comparisons, normalization of metrics (e.g., emissions per revenue or per garment), and trend analysis where multi-year data is available.

Finally, produce a ranked assessment of the three brands' overall ethical performance, justifying your conclusions using a weighted scoring framework or similar comparative method.

"I want to create my own restaurant empire, but I have zero idea where to begin. I know I want to serve indian food in with three different settings - food truck, elevated fine dining, and kitchen only/ fast casual model. All the three chains serve authentic indian food.

The food truck is Indian fast food, street style with some dishes that you can eat on the move with some innovation if required 

The elevated fine dining is a north indian fine dining setting with servers dressed as attendants from royal courts during the time of Indian Kings, the ambience should resemble to that of the biggest and most grandest of places in India - I want to show the world what Indian culture, history, and grandeur and servitude is. The dishes would be served in the authentic way it is served in the region the dish originated from. I would also like a place where the restaurant could host performances. I want my guests to be transported to India not only by food but also through the ambiance, the atmosphere. 

The kitchen only/ fast casual place would be parallel to the food truck in most ways but resemble more to Indian street style restaurants - people can see the cook prepare their food, and if its a fast casual place guests can come in sit chill and would be more modern

I have no idea how to go about this, do market research, competitor analysis, costing, what architects and designers should I contact, how much money would be required, the menu and basically everything else

"Write a comprehensive analysis for a graduate-level seminar on technology and society, evaluating the principles and practices of responsible AI use in the legal field. The analysis should compare the ethical, social, and economic implications of AI systems in two distinct contexts: (1) predictive policing (e.g., AI algorithms used to forecast crime hotspots or assess recidivism risk) and (2) AI-assisted contract analysis (e.g., AI tools for reviewing and drafting legal contracts).

Your report must:
* Detail the ethical considerations of AI in predictive policing, including issues of bias, transparency, and civil liberties, and their impact on public trust in law enforcement.
* Analyze the social and economic benefits and risks of AI in predictive policing, such as improved resource allocation versus perpetuation of systemic biases.
* Evaluate the ethical challenges of AI in contract analysis, including concerns about data privacy, accuracy of outputs, and accountability for errors.
* Assess the social and economic impacts of AI-assisted contract analysis, including efficiency gains in legal practice versus potential job displacement for legal professionals.
* Synthesize these two cases to draw broader conclusions about the principles of responsible AI in the legal field, including strategies for ensuring fairness, accountability, and transparency.
