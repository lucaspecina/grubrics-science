"[{'content': '(As I sat there in my room, I began to work on a drawing of some of my fellow club members as dragons - Sayori as a Sentinel, Yuri as a Deathgripper, Monika as a Night Fury, Sucrose as a Timberjack, Collei as a Snaptrapper, Himari as a Changewing, Kohana as a Whispering Death, and I even included my true Stormcutter form as a Titan-Wing. That’s when I heard someone - it was my “dad”. Of course, he isn’t really my dad - I just call him that. His real name is Masao.)\n\nMasao: “Natsuki, can I talk with you for a moment?”\n\n(I quickly ran downstairs, ignoring the fact my Stormcutter form’s tail is still visible.)\n\nNatsuki: “Sure, what’s up?”\n\nMasao: “I just wanted to check on how you’re doing. I know school and the club have been keeping you busy, and I want to make sure you’re taking care of yourself.”\n\nNatsuki: “Oh, yeah, I’m doing okay. Thanks for checking in.”\n\nMasao: “Good to hear. And I have to say, that drawing you’re working on is looking really impressive. You’re really talented.”\n\nNatsuki: “Thanks, Masao. I’m trying my best.”\n\nMasao: “Well, keep it up. And if you ever need to talk or if anything is bothering you, don’t hesitate to come to me.”\n\nNatsuki: “I will. Thanks for being there for me, Masao.”\n\nMasao: “Of course, Natsuki. You’re like family to me.”\n\n(I smiled at Masao’s words, grateful for the support system I had in my life. As I turned back to my drawing, I felt a renewed sense of inspiration and motivation to keep creating and pursuing my passions. And as I finally finished the drawing, I suddenly got a phone call - it was from Yuri. I could also hear two of the other girls on her end of the phone - Himari was reading some poems, while Kohana was writing something. But then I could hear Monika screaming in pain - and she was saying things like “It’s too early”, “I’m not due yet”, and “I should have cancelled the meeting today”.)\n\nNatsuki: “Yuri, what’s going on? Is everything okay?”\n\nYuri: “No, Natsuki. Monika just went into labor.”\n\nNatsuki: “What?! Is she okay? Should we call for an ambulance?”\n\nYuri: “We already did, but the nearest hospital is quite far. We’re trying to keep her calm. Can you come over and help us in the meantime?”\n\nNatsuki: “Of course! I’ll be there as fast as I can.”\n\n(I quickly packed up my drawing supplies and ran out of the house, my heart racing with worry for my friend. I made it to the club room in record time and found the girls gathered around Monika, who was lying on the floor, sweat pouring down her face.)\n\nNatsuki: “Monika! Are you okay? What can I do to help?”\n\nMonika: “Natsuki, thank goodness you’re here. I don’t think I can do this alone.”\n\nHimari: “I’ve been reading her some calming poetry, but she’s still in a lot of pain.”\n\nKohana: “And I’ve been trying to write a message to the hospital, but the reception is really bad in here.”\n\nNatsuki: “Okay, hang on. Let me see what I can do.”\n\n(I whipped out my phone and started Googling birthing tips and tricks. Within minutes, I was able to find some information that could help Monika through the delivery process.)\n\nNatsuki: “Monika, try taking deep breaths and focusing on something calming. Maybe listen to some music or focus on a particular spot on the wall.”\n\nMonika: (gasping for breath) “Okay… okay…”\n\n(I could see that Monika was struggling, but she was doing her best to stay calm. I held her hand and talked her through each contraction, telling her that she was strong and that she could do this.)\n\nHimari: “That’s it, Monika. Just keep breathing…”\n\nKohana: “I managed to send the message! An ambulance is on its way!”', 'role': 'user'}]",chat,chat,"{'ground_truth': '', 'rubrics': array([{'criterion': 'Response identifies that the required action is to continue the scene narrative and provides a continuation rather than analysis or unrelated content.', 'points': 9, 'tags': {'function': '', 'parameters': '', 'verifier': 'llm'}},
